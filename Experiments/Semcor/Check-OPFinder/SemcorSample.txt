O	The engagement was_supposed_to be all set for the big theater in McCormick_Place which Sol_Hurok ballet booker extraordinary considers the finest house of its kind in the country and of_course he does nt weep at the capacity either
O	It was all set
O	Allied_Arts corporation first listed the Chicago dates as Dec 4 thru 10
O	Later the Hurok office made it Dec 8 thru 17 a nice long booking for the full repertory
O	But if you keep a calendar of events as we do you noticed a conflict
O	Allied_Arts had booked Marlene_Dietrich into McCormick_Place Dec 8 and 9
O	Something had to give
O	Not La_Dietrich
O	We printed it
O	So I started making some calls of my own
O	These are the results

O	Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us
O	Well Dietrich wont budge from McCormick_Place
O	Then how about the Civic_Opera_house
O	Well Allied_Arts has booked Lena_Horne there for a week starting Dec 4
O	Queried about the impasse Allied_Arts said Better cancel the Kirov for_the_time_being

O	One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm
O	Another is a wily countryman called Larkin whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled I believe in earlier volumes of Mr_Bates comedie_humaine
O	The name of_it is Gore_Court and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T_S_Eliot
O	That s not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look_at it though
O	He conjures herds of deer and wild birds crowding the air
O	He suggests that Gore_Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor
O	The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas for_example will provide needed space for the extra television_sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids
O	They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox s life on earth
O	Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war
O	First the Larkins are ahead then the Jerebohms
O	He does nt think that potting them from a deck_chair on the south_side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting
O	These specialists I learned have done a great_deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers
O	Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains
O	I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants
O	I dig it rake it smooth sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray
O	Then I cover the sowing with a board
O	This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds
O	A light porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth
O	Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller
O	I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them
O	We put a light mulch over the seedlings now we must use a heavy one
O	Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool
O	Try pegging_down each separate branch to the earth using a bobby_pin to hold it there
O	Nature s aim different from ours is to provide for the coming generation
O	That done her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant
O	Here is a word_of_advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds
O	Many people think that pansies last only a_few weeks then their period of growth and bloom is over
O	That is not true
O	If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter the second year is more prolific than the first
O	Remove about half the branches from each plant leaving only the strongest with the largest buds
O	The flowers will be huge
O	The 103 cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 1958 using the 84 foot reflector at the Maryland_Point_Observatory of the US_Naval_Research_Laboratory
O	The age of the moon was about 2 days
O	The halfintensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18 5 and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian_shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon
O	Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas Argon
O	The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Amp
O	Qualitative observations were made and highspeed motion_pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities
O	The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical_phenomena occurring in free_burning arcs
O	In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat
O	The heat transfer to the anode is_due to the following effects 1
O	Heat_of_condensation work function plus kinetic_energy of the electrons impinging_on the anode
O	This energy transfer depends_on the current the temperature in the arc column the anode material and the conditions in the anode sheath
O	2
O	Heat transfer by molecular conduction as_well_as by radiation from the arc column
O	The heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas_jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up f
O	Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic_forces
O	3
O	Feed_back of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode
O	The third method was to our knowledge successfully applied for_the_first_time by C_Sheer and coworkers Ref 2
O	The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as_well_as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage
O	Gas injection through a porous anode transpiration cooling not_only feeds_back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself
O	A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper
O	Argon was used as a blowing_gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical_reaction
O	Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder
O	This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing
O	The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk
O	The transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below
O	Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2
O	Argon was also blown at low velocities mass flow_rate f through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air
O	The anode consisted_of a 12 inch diameter porous graphite plug 14 inch long
O	The graphite was National_Carbon_NC 60 which has a porosity of 50 and an average pore size of 30 This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode
O	The anode plug Figure 2 was inserted into a carbon anode holder
O	A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas
O	It was exposed to a high velocity gas_jet
O	A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts
O	This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection
O	Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 Pyrometer_Instrument_Co Model 95 served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder
O	Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature
O	Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3
O	In this design the anode holder is water_cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant
O	To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the region of the arc a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 116 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder
O	In_addition the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum_foil to reduce radiation
O	Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug
O	The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator
O	The power source was a commercial DC rectifier
O	At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less_than 05 V peak to peak with a resistive load
O	The current was regulated by_means_of a variable_resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter
O	The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders
O	The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between f
O	and f
O	This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously
O	For each mass flow_rate the arc voltage was measured
O	To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug the surface was scanned with a pyrometer
O	As it turned_out a very hot region occurred on the plug
O	The size of this hot region was estimated by eye
O	The f values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages
O	Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2
O	Some of these temperatures are plotted in figure 4
O	They showed no marked dependence on the flow_rate within the accuracy of these measurements
O	The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts
O	It was calculated from the temperature_gradient f at f inch as f
O	The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby f The temperature distribution of figure 4 gives f for all blowing rates assuming f
O	It consists_of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims
O	There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed
O	A tape of cellulose_acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks
O	In normal use weights are hung_on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks
O	After it has reached terminal_velocity the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded
O	By the use of various weights data for a force rate of shear graph can be obtained
O	The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described
O	In this test a f tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of f with a clearance of 0002 on each side of the tape
O	This gives a rate of shear of f
O	Consider a shear field with a height of H and a crosssectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of h referred to the same base as H and a crosssectional area of a
O	If f is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T and r is the density of the fluid then the total potential_energy of the system above the reference height is f
O	f is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h
O	The total volume of the system above the reference height is f and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential_energy of the system in_terms_of H
O	This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields
O	In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics_of_equilibrium referred to by some as thermostatics to the steady state
O	This is of_course a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies
O	This viscosity of the material in the drops is of_course not negligible
O	this is known as conformational_entropy
O	This conformational_entropy is in this case equal to the usual entropy for there are no other changes or other energies involved
O	The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect_gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings
O	A proton_magnetic_resonance study of polycrystalline f as a function of magnetic_field and temperature is presented
O	f is paramagnetic and electron paramagnetic dipole as_well_as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening
O	The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field f gauss and temperature f the asymmetry increases with increasing f and decreasing T
O	An isotropic resonance shift of f to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction
O	The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second_moment f of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to f
O	The theory predicts a linear dependence of f on f where j is the experimentally determined CurieWeiss constant
O	The experimental second_moment f conforms_to the relation f in_agreement with theory
O	Hence the electron paramagnetic effects slope can be separated from the nuclear effects intercept
O	The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes
O	The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in_terms_of various motional modified models of the f bond in f
O	There is ample evidence from many sources that the f bond in f is symmetric
O	The f distance in f is 226 A
O	Douglass has studied the crystal structure of f by xray_diffraction
O	Xray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit_cell corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of f
O	f
O	This space group requires the hydrogen_bond to be symmetric
O	Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for f
O	The O atoms in each sheet are close_packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms
O	The f layers are stacked normal to the 111 axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers
O	The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen_bonds

S	Rather it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate ethical medical treatment of serious diseases
S	With these gadgets impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light_bulbs ticks and buzzes he then carries_out a vicious medical con_game capitalizing on people s respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age
S	He milks the latest scientific advances translating them into his own special Buck_Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cureall for everything from hay_fever to sexual impotence and cancer
S	Not_only do these quacks assume impressive titles but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence
S	The medical device pirate of today of_course is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear the gallus snapping hawker of snake_oil and other patent_medicines
S	According_to the Food_and_Drug_Administration FDA Doctor Ghadiali Dr_Albert_Abrams and his clique and Dr_Wilhelm_Reich to name three notorious device quacks succeeded respectively in distributing 10000 5000 and 2000 fake health machines
S	But it is our health more precious than all the money in the world that these modern witch_doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away
S	By preying on the sick by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical_care these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity
S	Mr_A has recovered but he is justifiably a bitter man
S	For_instance
S	Unfortunately says Chief_Postal_Inspector_David_H_Stephens who has prosecuted many device quacks the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often can_not be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called_up in court
S	2 As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness
S	It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine
S	After_all the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen s comprehension and control
S	Anyone s identification with an international struggle whether warlike or peaceful requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement
S	It has come to mean myths legends tales songs proverbs riddles superstitions rhymes and such literary forms of expression
S	In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this
S	Enthusiastically Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul_Bunyan tales Abe_Lincoln anecdotes and labor_union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition
S	That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant

S	Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses deiodinating enzymes
S	A microsomal deiodinase with a pH optimum of around 8 and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine_nucleotide for activity has been identified in the thyroid Stanbury 1957
S	Further the gland is able to reuse a larger fraction of the thyroid_hormone deiodinated peripherally
S	As long_ago as 1851 it was pointed_out by Niepce 1851 that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid
S	In the last few years the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification Bates and Condliffe 1960 Pierce Carsten and Wynston 1960
S	The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally longacting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients Adams 1958

S	In litters of eight mice from similar parents the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8
S	What probabilities should be attached to these possible outcomes
S	The major question in this chapter is What is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials
S	On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver
S	Since the choice is by lot each_week the outcomes of different trials are independent
S	For the marksman we study sets of five shots f for the mice we restrict attention to litters of eight f and for the aces we toss three dice f
S	Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial we group these outcomes into two classes as in the example of the die where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes ace and not ace
S	In repetitions of the experiment from couple to couple the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors
S	Thus we do not score the number of bullseyes and the random_variable is not the number of successes
S	We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n
S	Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success
S	The several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random_variable X the total number of successes which is just the sum of the random_variables associated with the single trials
S	Their sum is X the total number of successes which in this experiment has the value f
S	The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo and Cairns to show that in f there are families of such cubes
S	A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve though it may_not lie entirely in the interior of C
S	Each point on C as a vertex may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction
S	To each paired vertex and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point ie the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing t
S	The set of intersections of f the rotated curve with the original curve C consists_of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at f plus the vertex itself
S	For the vertex at f these values will be denoted by f
S	The function f t defined in this way is multi valued
S	We consider now the graph of the function f t on f
S	We know that in the Cplane both C and f are analytic
S	The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve
S	Thus if e is sufficiently small there can be only one intersection of C and f near Q for if there were more than one intersection for every e then the difference between C and f near Q would not be a monotone function
S	This set must consist_of isolated points and closed_intervals
S	This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points
S	A tangent point Q in the Cplane occurs when C and f are tangent to one another
S	A continuous change in t through an amount e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve f
S	The first possibility results in a closed_interval of tangent points in the fplane the end_points of which fall_into category b or c
S	Thus the multiplicity of f for a given t must be an even number
S	But this is a contradiction for we know that the multiplicity of f t is odd for every t
S	They must in their planning be able to count_on at_least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years
S	Particularly when based upon a single dominant party governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest
S	The chief experience is the sensing of communion and in the higher religions of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power
S	Religion integrates and unifies
S	The common codes for religious action as_such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior bind the devotees together
S	The unifying effect of religion is also brought_out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more_or_less cohesive cultural units with religion as the dominant bond even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized
S	Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid 1958 the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied
S	The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections while the people were still experiencing post independence letdown and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957
S	Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue
S	Although a somewhat technical subject it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting_system indicated
S	It has been said of John_Stuart_Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found_out
S	For what I express in my remark is something going_on in me at the time and that of_course did not exist until I did come_on the scene
S	We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it
S	If anyone asked us after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at_all we should say that it made all the difference in_the_world that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there that if this had not occurred there was nothing left to be bad and that our assertion was in that case mistaken
S	He holds that goodness and badness lie_in feelings of approval or disapproval
S	This way of escape is theoretically possible but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not so_far_as I know been urged by positivists it is perhaps best not to spend time over it
S	And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in_the_first_place has faded
S	And this seems to me untrue
S	We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time but that it was the same point we were making
S	This resulted in damage to the occipital_lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also
