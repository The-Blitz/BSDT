<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The jury further said in term end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The September October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The jury said it did find that many of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Implementation of Georgia 's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department 's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary 's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court 's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Regarding Atlanta 's new million dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On other matters , the jury recommended that :
Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner 's Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court Friday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His petition charged mental cruelty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The petition listed the mayor 's occupation as `` attorney '' and his age as 71 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It listed his wife 's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">NE .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor 's attorney .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The mayor 's present term of office expires Jan. 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor 's race , a top official said Wednesday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Robert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attended .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken :
Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sam Caldwell , State Highway Department public relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd 's campaign .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Caldwell 's resignation had been expected for some time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home - where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Highway Department source told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a $ 10 per day increase in expense allowances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 - 31 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29 - 5 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After a long , hot controversy , Miller County has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election I ever saw in this county '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Davis received 1119 votes in Saturday 's election , and Bush got 402 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ordinary Carey Williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw '' , Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Being at the polls was just like being at church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I did n't smell a drop of liquor , and we did n't have a bit of trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` There was n't a bit of trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would `` amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $ 451500 , which would be a savings of $ 157460 yearly after the first year 's capital outlay of $ 88000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. Red Berry and Joe Ratcliff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While details are still be to worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry 's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We 're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting '' , said Ratcliff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I'm willing to stake my political career on it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rep. Berry , an ex gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The House passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department 's authority to give planning assistance to cities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One validated acts of school districts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two tax revision bills were passed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $ 1000 fine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The other bill , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $ 12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen /3 , of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Marshall Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under Formby 's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas ' big cities Thursday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bill would increase from $ 5000000 to $ 15000000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) de la Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` This is a poor boy 's bill '' , said Chapman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Grover also would require junior senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The remainder of the 4 - year college requirement would be in general subjects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` A person with a master's degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools '' , said Grover .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays , Kan. as the school 's new president .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon '' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott + Co. , committee chairman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other recommendations made by the committee are :
Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then Dick Hyde , submarine ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A two run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Catcher Frank House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A 's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani 's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair 's glove into center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on balls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then three consecutive pinch hitters failed to produce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2 - and 2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2 - hour and - 27 - minute contest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder 's single to right and crossed on Kunkel 's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel 's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry 's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy Carey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this :
Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde 's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Carey singled on a slow bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle 's 390 - foot homer over the wall in left center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army 's military training program and is ready for belated spring training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average , completes the Birds ' spring squad at 49 players .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The big , 22 - year old shortstop , the 1960 American league `` rookie of the year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $ 15000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5 - to 3 loss to Kansas City - the winless Birds ' sixth setback in a row .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox , Ky. , Hansen 's weight had dropped to 180 - `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I 'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Twenty-one year old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers ' Art Ditmar in Sunday 's 2 P.M. encounter .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third inning two run double off the left centerfield wall tonight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Just before game time , Robinson 's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately , Brooks ' teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick - several every Saturday , in fact - out of football .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the cotton bowl .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41 - 8 slaughter of Washington State .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you 'll get the quick response , `` place kicker '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A 208 - pound , 6 - foot 1 - inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he did n't get into a single game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` This year , coach Royal told me if I 'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me '' , said Moritz .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` So I started practicing on it in spring training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School , including one that beat Anson , 3 - 0 , in a 1953 district game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school '' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I never did miss one in a playoff game - I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Place kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Once you get the feel of it , there 's not much to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I 've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Practice helps you to get your timing down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's kind of like golf - if you do n't swing a club very often , your timing gets off '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` If you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We needed it and we got it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Nelson played magnificent football '' , Meek praised .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One was on a fourth down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon 's territory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He really crucified him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He nailed it for a yard loss '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Air Force's , and the game 's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He almost brought it back all the way '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game '' , Meek said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 'll be out of action all this week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` He 's looking a lot better , and he 's able to run '' , Meek explained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` We 'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I do n't know if he 'll be able to play '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday '' , Meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We 'll work out about an hour on Saturday , then we 'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper off '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday , Baylor worked out in the rain Monday - mud or no mud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">End Gene Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl 's game with LSU , was back working out with Rice Monday , and John Nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week 's idleness with an ankle injury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday - a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett , shaken up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Halfback Bud Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly mending sprained ankle , joined TCU 's workout Monday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts - a 19 - 12 triumph over the Denver Broncos - but their visit will be a short one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Texans have two more road games - at Buffalo and Houston - before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram 's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey , who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex National Football Leaguers , M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rabb , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22 - 12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers , defending league champions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Just our luck '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">exclaimed Stram .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team 's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Our interior line and our linebackers played exceptionally well '' , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` They can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang - they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfback .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was called upon 26 times - more than all of the other ball carriers combined - and delivered 145 yards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver 's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A quick touchdown resulted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I 'll put that play in the book '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The early Southwest Conference football leaders - Texas , Arkansas and Texas A+M - made a big dent in the statistics last week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Texas ' 545 - yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A+M , with a 38 - point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Texas leads in per game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor 's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas ' 189 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A+M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5 - 3 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The husky 6 - 3 , 205 - pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on the scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday 's opener , and never lagged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear 's attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After Al Paschal grounded out , Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert 's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer 's glove .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nischwitz was working on a 3 hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines ' infielder roller accounted for the tallies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik 's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite the 45 - degree weather the game was clicked off in 1 : 48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik 's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe 's eight hits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the season 's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Billy Gardner 's line double , which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field , drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6 - 5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He came all the way around on Gardner 's hit before 5777 fans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was Gardner 's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Turk Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green 's double to left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The White Sox had taken a 5 - 4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits - a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon - a walk and a sacrifice fly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jim Landis ' 380 - foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1 - 0 lead , but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Al Smith 's 340 - blast over left in the fourth - his fourth homer of the campaign - tied the score and Carreon 's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130 batting average in the first 12 games .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaited .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The conductor said to Ritchie : `` I do n't think you want to talk to him .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's mad at the world '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Jackie had gone into the station .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I told him who I was and he was quite cold .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And so it was over the weekend what with 40 - year old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie Mays retaliating with a record tying 4 - homer spree Sunday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2 - score year milestone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` Wish I was 40 , and a top grade big leaguer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">THE MODEST AND HAPPY Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all time great lefthanders in the game 's history .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player 's ball player , as they say in the trade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18792 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Spahnie does n't know how to merely go through the motions '' , remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn 's Ebbetts Field .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Willie 's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you 're an American or National fan and anti or pro Yankee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The record books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once the figure was 30 - 30 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Willie 's lifetime batting average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">THE DENVER-AREA TV audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the `` Living Room Athletic Club '' when games were cut off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This dissatisfaction led to Howsam 's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5 - game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13 - 5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15 - hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Johnny Blanchard , Mantle 's replacement , slammed a 2 - run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5 - run first inning .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The crowd of 32589 had only two chances to applaud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6 - 3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2 - run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11 - 5 and it really did n't matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only Bucky Harris , the `` boy manager '' of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Skorich received a three year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20000 and $ 25000 a year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff - Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Williams is a defensive coach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gauer works with the ends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The selection had been expected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin 's aerials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack - split between running and passing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Eagles signed him for Shaw 's staff in 1959 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Skorich began his new job auspiciously today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William A. Bill Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter , Baseball Writers Association of America , at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Shea , the chairman of Mayor Wagner 's Baseball Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter 's player of the year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A crowd of 1400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The 53 - year old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey 's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shea 's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bill Jr. , 20 ; Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shea was born in Manhattan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He played basketball there while working toward a law degree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was the lawyer for Ted Collins ' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League 's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maris is in line for a big raise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Palmer , golf 's leading money winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The writers ' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N. J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Horton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $ 80738 in prize money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $ 10000 diamond - studded Hickok Belt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par 5 hole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It made him human .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The world 's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He boomed a 280 - yard drive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the narrow fairway of a 508 - yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It is possible that I over corrected '' , he said ruefully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So he wound up with a dozen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock strewn gully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Willie 's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How many is that , Jim '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Thirteen '' , said Long Jim .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Nae , man '' , said Willie , `` ye must be countin ' the echoes '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had a 16 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Palmer 's dozen were honestly earned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nor were there any rules to save him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This knowledge has come in handy , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The ball floated downstream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He 'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he 's right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That 's how he first won the Masters in 1958 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155 - yarder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arnold 's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">asked Palmer of an official .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' , said the official .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You must play it where it lies '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll do as you say , but I 'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The golfing fathers ruled in his favor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football 's hall of fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The owners would like each club in the fourteen team league to play a home and home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out :
`` We 'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nine of the league 's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early season conflict in dates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates ' slower start this season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball 's world champions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Pirates have a 9 - 6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7 - 9 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons :
1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Broglio 's 4 - 0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; 3 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Redbirds ' disheartening 11 - 7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Manager Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After Thursday 's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Harvey Haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight 's game at Busch Stadium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Haddix has a 13 - 8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1 - 3 mark in 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he had n't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday 's game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mizell has won both of his starts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five home run day against the Giants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I have to stay with Nieman for a while '' , Hemus said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don Taussig in center '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good '' , Hemus said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` He should be getting back in the groove before long .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Until the Bucs ' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .300 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess .455 , Gino Cimoli .389 , Bill Virdon .340 , Bob Clemente and Dick Groat , each .323 , Dick Stuart .306 , Don Hoak .280 and Bob Skinner .267 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bill Mazeroski with .179 and Hal Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging their feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend , who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Friend is off to a great start with a 4 - 0 record but is n't likely to see action here this week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We 're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Virdon has been blasting the ball .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No plunkers for him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Pirates jumped off to an 11 - 3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7 - 6 , ending a two season fall-off on that milestone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1958 , the Birds were 3 - 10 on May 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A year later they were 4 - 13 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since 1949 , the St. Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The '49 team was off to a so-so 5 - 5 beginning , then fell as low as 12 - 17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club 's top since 1949 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since 1949 , the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York 's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They honored the battling Billikens last night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who , in the words of Coach John Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The most valuable player award was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski , Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition , a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann , the 6 - foot - 10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The boys had a tremendous respect for each other 's ability .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We 'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Do n't worry , Coach - we 'll get 'em all right '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg , sports editor of the Post-Dispatch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U. 's nationally televised victory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Benington said , `` I 've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After the coach listed all the boy 's faults , Hartweger said , `` Coach before I leave here , you 'll get to like me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mrs. Benington admired Gordon 's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` I want to thank coach 's wife for talking him into letting me play '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bob Burnes , sports editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann with his award .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Within a week after the injury , suffered in St. Louis 's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill 's bench doing what he could to help Benington .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the clock given him was the inscription , `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball , 1960 - 61 '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21 - 9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric , Donnell Reid , Bill Nordmann , Dave Harris , Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future '' , Benington pointed out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` By winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams ' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn 's take a super team to do it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College , 5 - 1 , at Crystal City .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len Boehmer also was 4 - for - 5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The game opened a busy week for Washington .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If it 's true that contented cows give more milk , why should n't happy ball players produce more base hits ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The two top talents of the time , Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And that 's meant as a boost , not a knock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mays and Mantle , both 10 - year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they 've never hit the heights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their heights , that is .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted .365 and also led the American League in home runs , 52 , and RBIs , 130 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Like the Yankees ' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by - or for - Willie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His best years were 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they 're going to pass those previous peaks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yes , we know , they 're professionals , men paid to play , and they should n't care how they 're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For that matter , Stan Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mantle , it 's apparent , resented Casey Stengel 's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The old man was almost too possessive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol ' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The opinion continues here that with a 162 - game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles ' Wrigley Field Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe Ruth 's 60 homers of 1927 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mays ' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Willie 's wonderful walloping Sunday - four home runs - served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Next to Leo Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are many soft and light shoe leathers available .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Softness is found in crushed textures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung like textures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do n't overlook the straws this year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacy open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a brighter nautical vein is Ile de France blue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Contrast trim provides other touches of color .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An electric toothbrush ( Broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the American bathroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition , the motor has the seal of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories , which means it is safe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of us brush our teeth by hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition , it is small enough to get into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back teeth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy of the bristles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It usually goes up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows , which gave him inferiority complexes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent , well-informed American .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His answer was simple but honest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The conscience is non-existent in the 2 - year old .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She can decrease the number of temptations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She can remove all knick-knacks within reach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If he can't play with Mommy 's magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If Daddy 's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child 's conscience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She tells him of the consequences of his behavior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he bites a playmate she says , `` Danny won't like you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If he snatches a toy , she says , `` Caroline wants her own truck just as you do '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is no use trying to `` Explain '' to a 2 - year old .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Actions speak louder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Remove temptations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He won't submit to his natural desires all the time , and it 's Mother 's love that is responsible for his good behavior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets - not yet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The biggest nuclear device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our B-52s are said to be carrying two 20 - megaton bombs apiece .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some time ago , however , Mr. Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the Soviet Union would make them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He seems to have at least a few 30 - and 50 - megaton bombs on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And now , of course , the hue and cry for counter escalation is being raised on our side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Khrushchev threatens us with a 100 - megaton bomb ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So be it - then we must embark on a crash program for 200 - megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So escalation proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">What is needed , Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell Daily Sun ( October 26 ) is a discontinuity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor Morrison writes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers - Europe of course must be written off out of hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the least risky path our government can take .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His proposal is opposed to that of Richard Nixon , Governor Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Edward Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in the name of national security .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation 's security are incapable of learning , or even of observing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He has gained only one thing - he has exploded a 50 - megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When East Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are less vocal now , when it is the West Berliners who are migrating .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The flood is not as great - only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account - but it is symptomatic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">West Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin 's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per cent are under fifteen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">R. H. S. Crossman , M.P. , writing in The Manchester Guardian , states that departures from West Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing off of East Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The gallant half city is dying on its feet '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in the Observer ( London ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mark Arnold-Foster writes : `` People are leaving [ West Berlin ] because they think it is dying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are leaving so fast that the president of the West German Employers' Federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six months ' front-line work in factories in West Berlin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Berlin 's resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle will be hard indeed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The handwriting is on the wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">State Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into East Berlin under military escort , will not avail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The materials for compromise are at hand : The Nation , Walter Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again and again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save Berlin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The removal of Stalin 's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A British writer , Richard Haestier , in a book , Dead Men Tell Tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding French Revolution the body of Henry /4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And in England , after the Restoration , the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Contemplating these posthumous punishments , Stalin should not lose all hope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In 1899 , Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster , facing Whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nikita Khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , Moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplores waste .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Who will take Stalin 's place beside Lenin ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is Karl Marx , of course , buried in London .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Who but Nikita himself ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since he has just shown who is top dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Suppose he did lie beside Lenin , would it be permanent ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If some future Khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary General - at this writing , the choice appears to be certain - offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites in the running , but France did n't like the former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold , U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">U Thant of course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr. Hammarskjold 's term would have come to an end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whether the compromises - on both sides - that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U Thant represents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In a sense , the showdown promised by Mr. Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as yet ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are mentalities which crave action - and they are beginning to get it , as Messrs. Salsich and Engh report on page 372 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Friends , a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley , Alabama .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast '' , the account reads , `` they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employees - all girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast moving Civil Defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute 's notice '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to Friends , the unit was organized by John Snook , a former World War /2 , commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck ; they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies ' accessories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This may be opera bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The doctrine has never worked ; it is not working now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; it cannot bring them into actual play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier - but the guns are real .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certainly not in Orchestra hall where he has played countless recitals , and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago Symphony orchestra , playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is , when Mr. Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , Mr. Hendl could go along .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Mr. Hendl does not go straight to any point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He flounders and lets music sprawl .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein , but not great Brahms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The concert opened with another big romantic score , Schumann's Overture to Manfred , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hindemith 's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands translucent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sawalisch also conducts `` The Flying Dutch '' , opening July 24 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Parsifal '' follows July 25 , with Hans Knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` Die Meistersinger '' , to be presented Aug. 8 and 12 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The `` Ring '' cycles are July 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and Aug. 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rudolf Kempe conducts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No casts are listed , but Lotte Lehmann sent word that the Negro soprano , Grace Bumbry , will sing Venus in `` Tannhaeuser '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Remember how BY a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Remember how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well , now we have two big theaters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But barring a miracle , and do n't hold your breath for it , Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov Ballet , which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming , not once but several times , indeed we did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in McCormick Place , which Sol Hurok , ballet booker extraordinary , considers the finest house of its kind in the country - and of course he does n't weep at the capacity , either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was all set .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Allied Arts corporation first listed the Chicago dates as Dec. 4 thru 10 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Later the Hurok office made it Dec. 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But if you keep a calendar of events , as we do , you noticed a conflict .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Allied Arts had booked Marlene Dietrich into McCormick Place Dec. 8 and 9 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Something had to give .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not La Dietrich .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Allied Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking , fly here to open Nov. 28 , and close Dec. 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Shorter booking , but still a booking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We printed it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So I started making some calls of my own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These are the results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Kirov Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium , Los Angeles , Nov. 21 thru Dec. 4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not a chance of opening here Nov. 28 - barring that miracle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well , Dietrich won't budge from McCormick Place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then how about the Civic Opera house ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well , Allied Arts has booked Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Queried about the impasse , Allied Arts said : `` Better cancel the Kirov for the time being .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's all up in the air again '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">H. E. Bates has scribbled a farce called `` Hark , Hark , the Lark '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another is a wily countryman called Larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , I believe , in earlier volumes of Mr. Bates ' comedie humaine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What 's up now ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Well , Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor house , or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And of course Larkin has just the thing they want .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It 's a horror .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The name of it is Gore Court , and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T. S. Eliot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it , though .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Larkin has an answer to all that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for example , will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He does n't really need the immense sum of money ( probably converted from American gold on the London Exchange ) he makes them pay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He has a glorious wife and many children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he needs money to buy something like , say , the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch , he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of those capital-gains ventures , in fact , has saddled him with Gore Court .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox 's life on earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If , in Larkin 's eyes , they are nothing but Piccadilly farmers , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First the Larkins are ahead , then the Jerebohms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling 's tales of India , does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He does n't think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel de Cervantes ' `` Don Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho Panza , in seventeenth century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nikolai Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible , performs the lanky Don Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The voices of all the characters , including that of Cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Splendid , too , is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev , one of Russia 's leading comedians , as Sancho Panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness - a sort of peasant dignity - too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">True , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half , before Don Quixote goes to the duke 's court .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten minute color film called `` Sunday in Greenwich Village '' , a tour of the haunts and joints .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago style jazz in prime evening time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC - TV Nov. 26 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The program came out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du Pont Show of the Week series .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If so , it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a matter of fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A few years ago a `` Timex All Star Jazz Show '' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from Lionel Hampton 's big band to the free-wheeling Dukes of Dixieland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">About that same time John Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cameras stared at soloists ' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Chicago and All That Jazz '' could not be faulted on the choice of artists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of the in-person performers were Jack Teagarden , Gene Krupa , Bud Freeman , Pee Wee Russell , Johnny St. Cyr , Joe Sullivan , Red Allen , Lil Armstrong , Blossom Seeley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The jazz buff could hardly ask for more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore , Garry Moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( He played host at the Timex show already mentioned . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the script 's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">NBC had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example , there was sheet music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business , which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another source of NBC pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists , the program turned out to be a not quite perfect example of either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti 's `` Lucia di Lammermoor '' Sunday night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic `` Mad Scene '' created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her entrance in Scene 2 , Act 1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thereafter the audience waxed applause happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She topped the sextet brilliantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad Scene '' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : A much more girlish Lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm up slowly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , Silvio Varviso .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He may respect too much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers ' opera may be quite difficult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Richard Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Miss Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( The first Metropolitan Opera broadcast on Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She has since turned to Bellini , whose opera `` Beatrice di Tenda '' in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her to New York last season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She will sing `` La Sonambula '' with it here next week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anyone for musical Ping-pong ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's really quite fun - as long as you like games .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You will need a stereo music system , with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new London `` Phase 4 '' records .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are 12 of these to choose from , all of them of popular music except for the star release , Pass in Review ( SP 44001 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays London 's new technique to the best effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time ; but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Percussive Twenties ( SP 44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and Johnny Keating 's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods ( SP 44005 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Big Band Percussion ( SP 44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs - the arrangements just did n't have so much character as the others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in Melody and Percussion for Two Pianos ( SP 44007 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface noise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pass in Review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Strange , but true - authenticity and realism often are n't related at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic - in fact , impeccably so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In any given period piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the making recently of an important Biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set 's edge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The drama itself - and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama - often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The storyline , in sort , is wildly unrealistic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , in `` The Story of Ruth '' we have Ruth , Naomi , and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline - i.e. , that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound up with Boaz - the film version has little to do with the Bible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And in the new `` King of Kings '' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Earlier this month Edward R. Murrow , director of the United States Information Agency , came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He talked about unauthentic storylines too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He intimated that they were n't doing the country much good in the Cold War .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Directed by Michael Murray ; settings by William David Roberts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The cast :
Producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season 's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr 's `` King of Hearts '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The dialogue is sharp , witty and candid - typical `` do n't eat the daisies '' material - which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10 - year old to provide him with fresh idea material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This is when his troubles begin , not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect to the hero 's sweetheart secretary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">John Heffernan , playing Larry Larkin , the cartoonist , carries the show in marvelous fashion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of David Hedison , Providence 's contribution to Hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his role .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He does , and more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A word should be said for Gary Morgan , a Broadway youngsters who , as the adopted son , makes life miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And for his playmate , Francis Coletta of West Warwick , who has a bit part , Billy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the whole , audiences will like this performance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the Matunuck cast does well by it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Newport Playhouse presents `` Epitaph For George Dillon '' by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton , directed by Wallace Gray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cast :
The angriest young man in Newport last night was at the Playhouse , where `` Epitaph for George Dillon '' opened as the jazz festival closed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For the hero of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He 's mad at a world he did not make .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore , he 's something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">An unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Not altogether a successful play , `` Epitaph for George Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk is terribly impressive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is a fine second act , as an example , one in which Samuel Groom , as Dillon , has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is an exciting young actor to watch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Also fine are Sue Lawless , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , Harold Cherry , as her scratchy spouse , and Hildy Weissman , as a vegetable in human form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wallace Gray has directed a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The cast :
Everybody fell in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater , and Shelley Berman was to blame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented , `` Once in Love with Amy '' is also , of course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of American musical comedy in our era .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after Act 2 , got a rousing opening chorus , `` Where's Charley ? ''</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">, and Berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is greatly to Berman 's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He dropped his earlier and delightful hamming , which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called `` Charley's Aunt '' , and let himself go with as an appealing an `` Amy '' as anybody could ask .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In brief , Berman played himself and not Bolger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The big audience started applauding even before he had finished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The whole production this week is fresh and lively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The ballet work is on the nose , especially in the opening number by `` The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students ' Conservatory Band '' , along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Berman , whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist , proved himself very much at home in musical comedy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Sparrow size Virginia Gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky Amy , while Melisande Congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All told , `` Where's Charley ? ''</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">ought not to be missed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , Mr. Berman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents C. Edwin Knill 's and Martin Tahse 's production of `` Fiorello ! ''</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">at Veterans Memorial Auditorium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The book is by Jerome Weidman and George Abbott , music by Jerry Bock , lyrics by Sheldon Harnick , choreography by Peter Gennaro , scenery , costumes and lighting by William and Jean Eckart , musical direction by Jack Elliott , and the production was directed by Mr. Abbott .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cast :
This is one of the happier events of the season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the Little Flower rides to break a lance again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I saw `` Fiorello ! ''</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company is every bit as good , and perhaps better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Bob Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom Bosley does , but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch one's self up and remember that this was n't really LaGuardia come back among us again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben , the distraught Republican Party district chieftain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And Paul Lipson , as Morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley 's dinner , was fine , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie , who became the second Mrs. LaGuardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jen Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And little Zeme North , a Dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` On the Side of the Angels '' and `` Politics and Poker '' were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` Little Tin Box '' even better than it was done by the New York cast ; all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The party at Floyd 's penthouse gave the `` chorines '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">LaGuardia 's multi lingual rallies , when he is running for Congress , are well staged , and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that does n't pause long in any one place , and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I'm glad to say there 's none of that distraction in this `` Fiorello ! ''
)</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Loew 's Theater presents `` Where the Boys are '' , an MGM picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The cast :
Since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich Brown senior , while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists , I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` Where the Boys are '' , but I shall do nothing of the sort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Instead - and not just to prove my objectivity - I hasten to report that it 's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort Lauderdale , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group - that is to say , sex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If most of them were n't exactly specific - well , that 's the way it is in life , I guess .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But at least it 's reassuring to see some teenagers who do n't profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Where the Boys Are '' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations - the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid '' is performing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of the female faces are new , or at least not too familiar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Dolores Hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was delighted with Paula Prentiss ' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one 's highest hopes might ask .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A couple of the males made good comedy , too - Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , I suppose this was the attitude the part called for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I must say , however , that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To anyone who remembers Newport at its less than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The second feature , `` The Price of Silence '' , is a British detective story that will talk your head off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For in the modern world neither `` spirit '' nor `` matter '' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller 's play The Crucible , which deals with the Salem witch trials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A teenage girl , Abigail Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend Samuel Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everyone in Salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept up by it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with Abigail and Parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The audience leaves the play under a spell , It is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the end the good man , John Proctor , expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says , `` A fire , a fire is burning !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I hear the boot of Lucifer , I see his filthy face '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yet are not we of the mid twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing '' as the devil , just as bad off as they - only in a different way ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even Mr. Miller himself seems uncertain on this score .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point : `` However , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer 's many faced lieutenants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And his belief is not to his discredit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Better minds than Hale 's were - and still are - convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">( page 33 ) On the other hand , a little later on he says :
`` Since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out God 's beard and the Devil 's horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon - such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man 's worthlessness - until redeemed - the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over Salem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For this does not account for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author 's convictions to the contrary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Think , for example , of the spirit of the Marine Corps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We cannot , of course , assign it any substance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is not material and is not a `` thing '' occupying space and time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So it is too with many other spirits which we all know : the spirit of Nazism or Communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team , the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux Klan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is the spirit which is the source of a community 's drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is for them a given which they and they alone possess .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The spirit of the Marine Corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is they , of course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find as they come into it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' - and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task - there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann 's intention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in non mythological ( or existential ) terms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But this statement is completely unconvincing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If Bultmann 's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man 's picture of himself and his world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann 's argument is disclosed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand - and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul 's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First Corinthians .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">by analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God 's providence , presents it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age '' ; and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at least , Bultmann .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For we must number here not only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not to mention those of `` the Chicago School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ! )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tillich as well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However much we may have to criticize liberal theology 's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann 's attempt to formulate such a theology has led .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl Barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , if what is at issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in question is false .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A second point requires more extended comment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by Barth , rests on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann 's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann 's point of view , are mythological .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One hundred years ago there existed in England the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Church Unity Octave , January 18 - 25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the Catholic side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For `` the tide is well on the turn '' , as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the present religious state of England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman Catholic cleric .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In any case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On my first Guy Fawkes Day here , I found Catholics as well as non Catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A Birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` The True Story of Guy Fawkes '' , which began :
`` When you pile your '' guy `` on the bonfire tomorrow night , I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the 355 years since the first Guy Fawkes Night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill King James /1 1 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the Catholic segment of England one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of English people are churchgoers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church of England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An amazing article in the Manchester Guardian of last November , entitled `` Fate of Redundant Churches '' , states than an Archbishops ' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics '' , and have done so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going to church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism , and that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' .</MPQASENT>

`` O Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon England , thy '' dowry `` , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith of our Fathers '' , which glories in England 's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims :
`` Faith of our Fathers : Mary 's prayers / Shall win our country back to thee '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` English '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , a writer in a recent number of The Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un English '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Now , not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non Catholic members of the University .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it in the mass media of England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On successive Sundays during October , 1960 , Paul Ferris ( a non-Catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church of England , the Church of Rome and the Nonconformist Church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid Victorian England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C. , where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free Church minister and a Catholic priest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr. Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr. Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And it was interesting to observe that B.B.C. .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">'s television film on Christmas Eve was The Bells of St. Mary's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Of course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr. Fisher , then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury , to the Vatican last December .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present system is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But how can one figure symbolize both ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To be the Savior and the Lord , Jesus Christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ; he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man 's history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not a circle , then , nor a straight line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it ; for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As represented by a spiral , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself ; yet each historical event remains unique .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Christ is both unique and universal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From God 's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For ' God had not rained ' , says the Scripture , before man was made , ' and there was no man to till the earth ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From this earth , then , while it was still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man , the beginning of humanity '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adam and Eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were , in fact , children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul ; therefore there is no need for him , as there is for Origen , to identify existence itself with the fall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Historical existence is a created good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words : `` So God created man in his own image ; in the similitude of God he created him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement : `` If the [ Holy ] Spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature ; and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image [ of God ] in his formation , but not receiving the similitude [ of God ] through the Spirit '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ; the similitude of God , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as follows :
`` So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And He laid down for him certain conditions : so that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was , in the words of Irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word of God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the nadir of that circuit is death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to God entails death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that [ moment ] they were handed over to it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday , as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday ; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In any case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The wages of sin is death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Man 's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God , must now be conformed to the shape of death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even death , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Wherefore also He [ God ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But He set a bound to his [ state of ] sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take place in the earth , so that man , ceasing at length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This applies to his picture of Adam .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If it was , then it must have been God 's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen asleep , much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because Christianity teaches not only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of Christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents do n't want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things '' because `` you 'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` Hey , lookit Mr. America , whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">After all , a guy 's gotta have a little ego !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Therefore it 's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret ; has never heard one unkind word from his parents ; and never has been taunted by his schoolmates !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada - Henri de Courcy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor Roland Claude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And they could n't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg - and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That 's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">There 's Gaetan d'Amours who is our newest Mr. Canada ; Jean-Paul Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; Jack Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; Charles Harve , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man '' subdivision award in the Mr. Canada event ; and a host of others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yesiree , the professor knows his muscles !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">About that time he began reading Mr. America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein , those two wonder-working Weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well , sir , they did real great !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For in almost less time than it takes to tell it , Henri 's body weight was increasing rapidly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course he did some exercising - he 's crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really does n't have to work them very much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was muscular but it was n't symmetrical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` A real ' nothing ' torso '' , says Henri .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It never seemed to widen , it just got longer and longer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's when he went to Professor Claude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked out '' equipment since Vic Tanny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider Push-Pull Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide grip Straight-Arm Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As you can see , in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Super-Set No. 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat benches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the pecs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one dumbbell Bent-Arm Pullover .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the `` push '' exercise is the wide grip Pushup Between Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral rib cage stretcher ever invented !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You 'll know when you 've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a wide grip .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He has to ; he just can n't do anything about it at all !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But as you can also see , it 's not a painful exercise at all , because Henri de Courcy - the `` happy '' bodybuilder - looks as though he were having the time of his life !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The last exercise of Roland Claude 's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By this time Henri 's entire chest back - lat shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral front deltoid shaping work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press ( note the high incline ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and lats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests that steel edged `` carved out of solid rock '' looks of the great champions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , four of No. 2 , four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press , you can see that Henri de Courcy has had a terrific mass building , muscle shaping , torso defining workout that cannot be improved upon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe of true Herculean build .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workouts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only when the newest Mr. America or Mr. Universe rediscovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The exercise I shall discuss in this - the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition specialization of a particular body part - is the One Leg Lunge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline - that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders - a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike - the facet of muscular development that wins prizes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But for purely definition purposes - used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg Curling , Leg Extensor programs - a heavy weight is not needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective :
It 's a complete thigh contraction extension exercise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It increases flexibility of the legs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused on each .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You 'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and here 's the way it 's done :
Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Place a suitably loaded barbell across them ; grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments , just for safety .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance wise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oh , you 'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But do n't worry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you 'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there 's no reason why you should n't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Squat style lifters and leg split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The most beautiful bed of pansies I 've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He seemed puzzled by my question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I just love them '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The more I talked with him , the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These specialists , I learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ; but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His soil was `` nothing special '' , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown black .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is n't easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It does n't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pansies do n't have to be coddled ; they 'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then I cover the sowing with a board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I like sawdust for this , or hay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it 's time to set them out where they are to remain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The moral is : do n't transplant it any oftener than you must .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As soon as they are large enough to move , I put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pansies are gluttons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I spade lots of compost into their bed ; lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a little sand had been added , and I had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors ' experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They need mulch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; now we must use a heavy one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When winter comes be ready with additional mulch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do n't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days , you 'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If those are n't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( An unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In response to the lengthening days of February they budded , then bloomed their 4 - inch velvety flowers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That cold frame was my morale builder ; its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Like strawberries in December , pansies are far more exciting in February than in May .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy '' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nature 's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ; in fact it is easier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is not true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would you like to grow exhibition pansies ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The flowers will be huge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pansies have character .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Treat them right and they 'll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they 'll repay your solicitude with beauty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocado anywhere in the United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you have n't made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear , but oily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The avocado should have a `` give '' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange ; it is subtle and rather bland , nut like .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to - not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes it takes several `` eatings '' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is brought to packing houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The fruit is then cooled to 42 ` F. , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grove like temperature ( room temperature ) is restored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This happens on the grocer 's shelf or in your kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is thick , much like an egg plant 's skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins and C - about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin E requirement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The B vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">None of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dr. Wilson C. Grant , of the Veterans ' Administration Hospital , Coral Gables , Florida , and the University of Miami School of Medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then they were given 1 2 to 1 - 1 2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The lyric beauties of Schubert 's Trout Quintet - its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies - make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music - yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The occasion for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great Recordings of the Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whether considered alone or in relation to other editions , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of all time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford Curzon , Frank Glazer , Adrian Aeschbacher , and Victor Babin ) also sheds light on the master 's pedagogical skills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel 's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student 's approach as distinctly his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Schnabel 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And although Schnabel 's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert 's dynamic markings and phrase indications .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">About the Pro Arte 's contribution I am less happy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Turning to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some of Curzon 's playing strikes me as finicky , however .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Why , for example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The assisting musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( Special compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp :
his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Glazer-Fine Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But having lived with the disc for some time now , I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel 's or Fleisher 's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Aeschbacher 's work is very much akin to Schnabel 's , but the sound on his Decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet ( RCA Victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel 's keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Badura-Skoda-Vienna Konzerthaus ( Westminster ) and Demus-Schubert Quartet ( Deutsche Grammophon ) are both warm toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Helmut Roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last mentioned pianists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $ 2.98 ) is worthy of consideration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Returning once again to the Schnabel reissue , I am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist 's musical penetration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here is truly a `` Great Recording of the Century '' , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This recording surely belongs in everyone 's collection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Must records always sound like records ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl Muck 's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects :
the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This difference is made up of many factors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The sound may be good ; but if you know The Real Thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Command 's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro con spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer 's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari 's melodramatic contrasts between ultra vehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super high fidelity '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff 's abridgment for RCA Victor ) I find the cleaner , less razor edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable - but this may be the result of processing defects in my SD copies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is particularly true in site selection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological Society , washington 25 , D. C. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In recent years many counties and the U. S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor 's office showing ownerships of land .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are a great aid for planning use back at the office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">County judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How much study is required ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You need answers to four important questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What are the existing recreation features ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How well can the site be developed ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How useful will it be to the public ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is this site available ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Quality is vitally important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wildlife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The quantity of water flow may be critical ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Check the quality of the water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth 's crust in your region .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those which tell a story of the earth 's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How well can the site be developed ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many things need to be checked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The size of the area alone can be a determining factor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An area may be too small for the needs of the project .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman 's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Topography is very important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ball fields , etcetera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">- In addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The extent and location of open areas is noted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- How much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason - they were better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined - and something else - they were better dancers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But why gymnastics at all ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And is the sport really important ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Taking first things first , let 's understand the sport called gymnastics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was in favor of games .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The American is very lucky if he has three .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And what has dancing to do with all this ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A great deal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Russia 's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They were further stripped of old wives' tales by seeing the slender , lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength - and with not one bulging muscle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">School teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy 's request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Very little in today 's living provides the strength we need , and nothing provides the flexibility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dancers do have flexibility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11 - year old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin up each time they pass under it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the Horse Kick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Start on hands and feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Start on the knees in a large circle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Push back up and repeat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do this exercise six times each class period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of course those who have developed more will find them easier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At first each child should do a kick up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The left will follow at once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The right will land first , followed by the left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Return to the standing position .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This will prevent flat falls and toe injuries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Arch the back upwards to make a bridge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Have the class lie prone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Place the hands in front of the chest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Keep the legs straight and the toes pointed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The last essential to the beginner 's gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This used to be part of every child 's bag of tricks , but few children can do it today ; some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis ; then no matter what happens , the child 's performance will be controlled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">These are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training - and can contribute even more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer 's training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art , and a further `` on the spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses - architecture versus interior design - let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin with , what is an interior designer ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The Dictionary of Occupational Titles '' published by the U. S. Department of Labor describes him as follows :
`` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition to this the U. S. Civil Service Bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This seems like a large order .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yet even here many a problem is presented ; as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command - `` design a luxury apartment '' ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities - simply `` a luxury apartment '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior design demands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is like medical schools in India where , in that fairy land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow - that the student already is `` in the trade '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers , National Society of Interior Designers , Home Fashions League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses '' in their membership requirements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The necessity of that day has long disappeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses '' has long since passed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No one can deny that these `` back door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching - minimal income and minimal status among their confreres .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In all `` degree '' courses in interior design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One technical question of school organization comes to mind here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The question , however , cannot be ignored for long .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One solution is the acquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is a sort of academic ring-around-a rosy and you solve it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation - as do medical schools - by an art accreditation group such as the `` National Association of Schools of Art '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I can n't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This experience will have happened to many of you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vu ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vu , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Occasionally there are examples of prevision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rudyard Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we do n't remember having seen in real life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ; whereas , it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A `` mental image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vu , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The Theory Of Representative Perception , in the book Philosophies Of Science by Albert G. Ramsperger says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever existent past fantasy future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dr. H. V. Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest 's information .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht 's subconscious reasoning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Which theory is more fantastic : 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">that the perfect continuity was composed from the job lot of memory impressions in the professor 's brain , or 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja vu feeling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper 's mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vu , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If deja vu is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chauncey Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vu .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One week before the convention , Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson , gazing at the opposite shore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Franklin D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in Bakersfield , California , several months ago as a prospective patient .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up - presto - with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had - he informed her - kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( He explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He knew just the thing for her - a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As he applied the applicator extending from the machine - which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base - to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer 's body , Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo scientific mumbo-jumbo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people 's health ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The human body - he pointed out , for example - required 33 units of blue light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For that reason , he informed her , the Lord made the sky blue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her :
`` Do n't you worry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This machine will cure your cancer ridden body '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Cancer '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Shaefer practically shrieked .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why , I once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He urged her to buy one of his machines - for $ 300 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When she said that she did n't have the money , he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again '' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leaving Lee 's office , Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For several days , she was ill as a result of Lee 's treatment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $ 30000 for his ozone machines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For Mrs. Shaefer - who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee - and her friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee 's quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend 's clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin D. Lee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The charge : violation of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sentence : 360 days ' confinement in the county jail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An isolated case of quackery ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By no means .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals , wires , and radio parts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">With these gadgets - impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes - he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people 's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $ 5 to $ 10000 - anything the traffic will bear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He may call himself a naprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor '' - or what have you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations - foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The medical device pirate of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear - the gallus snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His plunder is therefore far higher - running into hundreds of millions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">According to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr. Albert Abrams and his clique , and Dr. Wilhelm Reich - to name three notorious device quacks - succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sarah Gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $ 1020 to a masseur , and Mr. A. , a laborer , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You will come up with a frightening total .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's why the FDA , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , and the National Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ 610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Postmaster General recently reported that mail order frauds - among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently - are at the highest level in history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Similarly , the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation - turned up by their inevitably limited policing - of the real loot of the medical racketeer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But it is our health - more precious than all the money in the world - that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">By preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Typically , Sarah Gross and Mr. A both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor '' was using were phony .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. A. , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife - a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple sclerosis - and himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Mr. A has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's a lot of hard earned money to lose '' , he says today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor 's treatments '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And there was the case of Tom Hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After his pains got worse , Tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yes , Tom caught it in time to stay alive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he 's a welfare case now - a human wreck - thanks to this modern witch doctor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud 's cure-all gadget can prove fatal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For instance :
In Chicago , some time ago , Mr. H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike '' - a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent - sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $ 306 as a cure-all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have '' , said the company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. H. is dead today because he followed this advice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Doris Hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see Otis G. Carroll , a sanipractor - a licensed drugless healer - in Spokane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Carroll diagnosed Mrs. Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic '' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $ 50 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His prescription : hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , Carroll permitted her to go on a 10 - day fast in which she took nothing but water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Inevitably , Mrs. Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , her husband and child contracted T.B. from her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $ 35823 for his wife 's death . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In California , a few years ago , a ghoul by the name of H. F. Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $ 5 to $ 10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $ 185 each .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify : He was dead of cancer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By no means are these isolated cases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Unfortunately '' , says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Death !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Have no doubt about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's where device quackery can lead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Who are the victims of the device quacks ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Says Wallace F. Jannsen , director of the FDA 's Division of Public Information : `` Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like Mr. A. , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor Fraud 's avarice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are often ignorant as well as underprivileged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are cases in point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical Association were founded in the 1880's , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">After all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever changing land .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Parson Weems 's George Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And their roles are paralleled by those of Patrick Henry , Nathan Hale , Andrew Jackson , Davy Crockett , Theodore Roosevelt and many , many more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">1 ) Most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul Bunyan tales , Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As long as his material is Americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other we have the flag wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever expanding and changing society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The problems confuse even the experts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They have widely varying backgrounds and aims .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They have little `` esprit de corps '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he does n't care much about the dollar sign or the footnote .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons hunt game ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts - one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth century German scholarship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The commercial propagandist , who can n't afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst 's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result , most people do n't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is the writer propagandistic ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Robert Frost , for instance , writes about rural life in New England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk poet '' , simply because he is a rural one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stephen Vincent Benet 's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John Steinbeck 's The Grapes of Wrath and Carl Sandburg 's The People, Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , there is much evidence to indicate they do n't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for `` the good old days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity :
a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An early Edison production was The Execution of Mary Queen of Scotts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; the headsman swung his axe ; the head dropped off ; end of film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one minute shows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke the Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin S. Porter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Of the two , Porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In a series of fairy tales and fantasies , Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So is the time of the novel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames '' , 35 - mm.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- wide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is the rate of projection ; it is also the rate of photographing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end - elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's tricks produced on film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Overnight , for one thing , Porter 's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Great Train Robbery is a one reel film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One reel - from eight to twelve minutes - became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth of a Nation in 1915 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ; much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it - good guys and bad guys in the old West - pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter 's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did more than that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child 's grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ; you are employing the basic technique of film ; you are cutting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is what Porter did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher 's little daughter arrives with her father 's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She dashes around in alarm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The two events are taking place at the same time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Time and space have both become cinematic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We leap from event to event - including the formation of the posse - even though the events , in `` reality '' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking out - instinctively or by design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The man was D.W. Griffith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he came to the movies - more or less by accident - they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not that there had not been attempts , mostly European , to do exactly that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Great actors and actresses - the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt - were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not surprisingly , this approach did not work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is these other differences between North and South - other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare - which I chiefly discuss herein .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A Southerner married to a New Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any more in the world of to-day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am naive , they say , to make use of such words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal 's attitude toward the South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Time 's editor , Thomas Griffith , in his book , The Waist High Culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep South ) I found myself unsympathetic to '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But in our case - and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts - the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee hatred displayed in social gatherings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From my wife 's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The strong feeling is certainly there ; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are of course many Souths ; but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who have n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I never heard of a poll being taken on the question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the Supreme Court 's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North Carolina , and Alabama following along after them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The long settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South - to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith - finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this , in effect , means most of modern America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking : do n't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream , like everybody else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Regardless of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre World War I , great power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So instead of being tests of the South 's loyalty , the Spanish War , the two World Wars , and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England , there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The North should thank its stars that such has been the case ; but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many Northerners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy increasing properties of the external world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One wonders about its applicability to people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The answer is of course yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We have ample light when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At what stage are social sciences then ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lucretius has remarked : `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps things were even worse then .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We are worried about what people may do with them - that some crazy fool may `` push the button '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They include both individual fears and collective ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A meteor could fall on San Francisco .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet we no longer feel uneasy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What elements of our behavior are decisive ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the group of boys it is different .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determining them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as `` trust '' , `` cheat '' , and `` get tough '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Small wonder , then , that we fear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio - and physiological chemistry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In some areas , the progress is slower than in others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In child care , the opposite extreme prevails ; procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The situation with regard to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann 's work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` bird like brain '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">La^utner , for his part , `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved - the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby - touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby 's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The music which La^utner has composed for this episode is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And this occurs now , at the refrain of Jacoby 's song - at the point , in fact , of the name `` Lizzy '' - ; a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` A miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife 's infidelity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; he collapses , and dies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann 's work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann 's heroes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible ; and the motion toward it brings disaster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio Kro^ger , Aschenbach , Leverku^hn ) who suffers from it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann 's stories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Professionally a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised - that is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ; that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and La^utner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann 's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Something of this can be learned from `` The Way to the Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no more `` plot '' than that ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end ; that is to say , to the churchyard '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But that is too simple , and won't hold up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the highroad , according to the description of its traffic , belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life :
a suffering form , an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers `` marched in their own dust and sang '' , while on the footpath one man walks alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This man 's isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth ; also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His name is Praisegod Piepsam , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author 's repertory - he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in `` Death in Venice '' , for example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` Life '' - that and a license number , which Piepsam uses in addressing him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Life '' points out that `` everybody uses this path '' , and starts to ride on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` Life '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His rage assumes a religious form ; that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life - not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well : `` all you light-headed breed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then an ambulance comes along , and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Piepsam 's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because God will not stop him ; as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : `` His justice is not of this world '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Life is further characterized , in antithesis to Piepsam , as animal : the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon is `` admirable '' , `` a pleasure to contemplate '' ; another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid of interest '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Piepsam calls the cyclist `` cur '' and `` puppy '' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The ambulance is drawn by two `` charming '' little horses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ; the two may in fact be identical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings ; he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue - and still in the end capitulated '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , `` blithe and carefree '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Piepsam is grotesque , a disturbing parody ; his end is ridiculous and trivial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And if I have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann 's writing :
the crude sketch of Piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for instance , Naphta and Leverku^hn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipates a kind of musical composition , as well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverku^hn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It resembles , too , pictures such as Du^rer and Bruegel did , in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for example , or a deadly sin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Gladius Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The Way to the Churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` Life '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art shop of M. Bluthenzweig ; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according to gossip , upon the painter 's mistress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Hieronymus , like Piepsam , makes his protest quite in vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : `` Gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter '' .</MPQASENT>

It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600 ` K .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal components .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mars has been observed twice at about 3 - cm wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In spite of this , the very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at Full Moon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves , although opaque to infrared radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The infrared emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the absorption of radio waves in rocklike material varies with wave length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The radio emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference like radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from Jupiter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">13 ) and Gallet ( chap.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">14 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 cm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The observable characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the waves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The measurements made with the NRL 50 - foot reflector , which is altitude azimuth mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Recent interferometer measurements ( Radhakrishnan and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the 960 - Mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other than this very significant result , most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black-body which subtends the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The apparent black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiates as a black body , will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1 ` K .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At meter wave lengths and increase of the order of 10 ` K in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wave-length range .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; see also chap.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">11 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers , must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness temperatures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959 a ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6 ' .7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Very recently , observations have been made at 8 - mm wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 ' ( Amenitskii , Noskova , and Salomonovich , 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The constant temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the 50 - foot reflector at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam was about 9 ' , and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 b ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon 's disk is nearly uniform .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The result of the observations is ( in ` K ) **f where the phase angle , |qt , is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This result is plotted along with the 8.6 - mm observations of Gibson ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , a .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The variation in the 3 - cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much less than the variation in the 8.6 - mm emission , as would be expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The 10.3 - cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the 84 - foot reflector at the Maryland Point Observatory of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The age of the moon was about 2 days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18 ' .5 , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy A detailed energy balance of the anode was established .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Amp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In free burning electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of **f as measured by the authors - the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects : 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Heat of condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging on the anode .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This energy transfer depends on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Heat transfer by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker ( Ref.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">1 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">3 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Feed back of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for the first time by C. Sheer and co-workers ( Ref.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">2 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not only feeds back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Argon was used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The anode material was porous graphite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sintered porous metals should be usable in principle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , direct comparisons can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( Ref.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">3 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cathode consisted of a 1/4 '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper tube .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Argon was also blown at low velocities ( mass flow rate **f ) through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The anode consisted of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug , 1/4 inch long .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The graphite was National Carbon NC 60 , which has a porosity of 50 % and an average pore size of 30 This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The anode plug ( Figure 2 ) was inserted into a carbon anode holder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was exposed to a high velocity gas jet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 ( Pyrometer Instrument Co.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Model 95 ) served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the region of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The power source was a commercial D.C. rectifier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A high frequency starter was used to start the arc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to reduce the number of variable parameters , all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5 '' and a current of 100 Amp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">and **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a pyrometer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As it turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its temperature was denoted by **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The size of this hot region was estimated by eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was denoted by **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : **f where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon , the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation **f whereby the specific heat of argon was taken as **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The **f values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of these temperatures are plotted in figure 4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , the dotted line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of **f .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the use of various weights , data for a force rate of shear graph can be obtained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this test a * * f tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of * * f with a clearance of 0.002 '' on each side of the tape .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This gives a rate of shear of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The face of one block contained a hole 1 16 '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Two of the fluids showed a high positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although the tape was run for over 1 hr.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">, a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The maximum suction was 3.25 '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head * * f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These experiments can be considered exploratory only .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The elasticity as a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The actual change * * f caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the volume is the molal volume , then * * f is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the * * f calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of h ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of a .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If * * f is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and |r is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">* * f is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The total volume of the system above the reference height is * * f , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This gives * * f , which is the pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The relation between osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics of equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to Philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by * * f where |c is the angle of extinction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the * * f calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one 's hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These droplets appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mason and Taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45 ` at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The relative forces can be calculated from the various radii of curvature if we assume : ( A ) The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( C ) The kinetic effects are negligible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( D ) Since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is * * f and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is * * f , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is * * f , where |g is the interfacial tension and * * f and * * f are the two radii of curvature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If a is the major axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis is * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Measurements on the photograph in this paper give * * f at the maximum rate of shear of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of * * f , cosec 2lc applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its value was * * f from the above data .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In other words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This means that work equals q which in turn equals * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that * * f , where \q is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">this is known as conformational entropy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This conformational entropy is , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes or other energies involved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline **f as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field **f gauss and temperature **f the asymmetry increases with increasing **f and decreasing T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An isotropic resonance shift of **f to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment **f of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The theory predicts a linear dependence of **f on **f , where |j is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The experimental second moment **f conforms to the relation **f in agreement with theory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the **f bond in **f remains in doubt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">**f appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electrons on the chromium , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong **f bond provides structural interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We first discuss the **f bond in **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional modified models of the **f bond in **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the **f bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical **f distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is ample evidence from many sources that the **f bond in **f is symmetric .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The **f distance in **f is 2.26 A .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is evidence , though less convincing than for **f , that the **f bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the **f bond becomes symmetric when the **f bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric **f bonds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Douglass has studied the crystal structure of **f by x-ray diffraction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He finds the structure contains an **f bond with the **f distance of **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is , then , the possibility that this **f bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The x-ray data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under this assumption the space group must be **f and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">**f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These data lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The **f layers are stacked normal to the [ 111 ] axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The gross details of the structure appear reasonable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off **f , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with **f at **f and **f at **f ( space group **f ) , where **f represents the oxygens on one side of the **f layers and **f those on the other side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non hydrogen bonded **f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 A .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general , rather than special , positions along the [ 111 ] axis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If the **f bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ( 3 ) hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Position ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Douglass prepared his sample of **f by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic acid at 300 - 325 ` C .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A well publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder / active ratio .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hard surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition , many of the hard surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These hard surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An oversimplified differentiation between soft - and hard surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In contrast , a metal coupon * * f in size would have a magnitude from 100000 to a million less .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Spring used a Brush surface analyzer in a metal cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending upon surface roughness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard surface cleaning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Exclusive of esthetic values , such as high - or low foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No matter how they are formulated , a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a build-up of `` tattle-tale grey '' and dirty spots - sometimes with bad results even after the first wash .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Harris has indicated that two devices , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this way , numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatches before and after washing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As is the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Large numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The problems of hard surface cleaning are not nearly as complex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In hard surface cleaning , the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , when the proper inorganic constituents are employed , practically any wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard surface cleaning formulation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard surface cleaners .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below :
Dirt , which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long chain organic acids ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Stains , which include the wide variety of nonparticulate materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Miscellaneous soils , which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of van der Waal 's forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles , or to stick to an uncharged surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Obviously , if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids , including liquid greases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greases , stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In most cases , these soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In an essentially static system , an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts , to some extent , as a dissolving and solvating agent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore , detergents are used .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As is well known , detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants , including the soaps , have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( 3 ) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized ends ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances such as greases , oils , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Related to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil water interfaces in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then during washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil-water interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure ( see Table 26 - 2 on p. 1678 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , for aqueous media , we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The negatively charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It does not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on sorption desorption phenomena which will be discussed later ( see pp.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">1746 - 1748 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as : * * f The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` synergistic '' properties has gained widespread acceptance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built detergent formulation ; and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The thermal exchange of chlorine between * * f and liquid * * f is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180 ` and above .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65 ` using light absorbed only by the * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the gas phase , with * * f of * * f and * * f of * * f , quantum yields of the order of * * f have been observed at 85 ` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It appears possible to set a lower limit of about * * f for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form * * f radical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals , as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon halogen bond .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; also it would be expected that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for * * f radicals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition to the method described in the section above , chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a * * f eutectic on the vacuum line , and by exchange of * * f with molten * * f .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table /1 .

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In series /1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm. .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series /2 , where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size - a 1000 - | m diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar corpuscular radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth 's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">De Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more eccentric without changing the semi major axis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are several possible sources .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">According to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Beyond a few million kilometers from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth 's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cores of deep sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors ( essentially microphones ) and from wire gages ; these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space probes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Statistically , the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer 1 , ) , 1958 Delta 2 ( Sputnik 3 , ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard 3 , ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These vehicles , with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive area exposure time products contribute some information .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was * * f for particles of mass greater than * * f ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The data show daily and diurnal variations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth 's orbit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On May 15 , a very large increase occurred with * * f of mass between * * f and * * f ; for the next two days , the impact rate was * * f ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than * * f ( Nazarova , 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Preliminary data from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of * * f for masses larger than * * f for about 1000 events in a 22 - day period ( LaGow and Alexander , 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor of 4.5 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements , a mass distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 7 2 power of the radius .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Space probes have yielded little information .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pioneer 1 , recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts , the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the United States , most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of * * f in the U.S. work and * * f in the U.S.S.R. work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The threshold mass of about * * f corresponds to a 10 - | m diameter sphere of density * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The velocity value used is also open to some question ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth , only about one third the above mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The diurnal variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5 - 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density * * f except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar radiation pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The figures in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent shielding by the Earth ; hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth 's atmosphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the Earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; for example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a * * f , zero magnitude meteorite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The mass scale used in Table 5 - 1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The approximate equation is * * f , where n is the number of * * f with electron line density greater than or equal to * * f , and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore , n is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7 2 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the fifteenth magnitude , * * f , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple 's table .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The solar electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of deep sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions ( Pettersson , 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per cent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The major reason for this is that it has no quick kill effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an aerosol or cloud of agent over the target area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assessment techniques .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The intra nasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract , such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi , are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This area is highly susceptible to infection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intra tissue inoculation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In considering BW defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical meteorological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It will rise during lapse conditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are , of course , certain times during the 24 - hour daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Certain other properties of small particles , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract , are noteworthy in defense considerations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An aerosol of such small particles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">moreover , diffuses through structures in much the same manner as a gas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens , restaurants , food stores , hospitals , etc. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Depending on the organism , there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products , i.e. , in milk for example .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials :
In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological conditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which facilitates its sampling and assessment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Four hundred and fifty pounds was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156 miles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34000 square miles was covered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a non pathogenic organism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An aqueous suspension of the spores of B. subtilis , var.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">niger , generally known as Bacillus globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A satisfactory cloud was produced even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this test , 130 gallons of a suspension , having a count of * * f organisms per ml , or a total of approximately * * f spores , was aerosolized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel , cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-shore breeze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Spraying continued along a two mile course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This operation was started at 5 : 00 p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a slight lapse condition , a moderate fog , and 100 per cent relative humidity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government Offices , buildings and reservations within the trial area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors of a Government office building .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four hour period , a four-fold increase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As can be seen from these dosage isopleths , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area sampled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly downwind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The dosages in the three levels of the vertical profile were : * * f This was not , of course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by the natural portal of entry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Botulinal toxin , for example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit fever '' on a finger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism , a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Biological agents are , of course , highly host specific .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The question of epidemic disease merits some discussion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics , it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">this is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This , of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A hypothetical example will illustrate this point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus ( Rickettsia prowazwki ) over City A and that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this case , then , the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand , a similar attack might have been made on City B whose population was known to be lousy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The same delivery vehicles - whether they be airplanes , submarines or guided missiles - should be usable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , precooked and even predigested foods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Abelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Speer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from DEAE-cellulose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti - A and anti - B agglutinins from preisolated | g-globulin samples .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Serum samples were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O donors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three of the anti - Rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One contained complete antibody and had a titer of 1 : 512 in saline .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The second contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of 1 : 256 in albumin and 1 : 2048 by the indirect Coombs test .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The third , containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies , had titers of 1 : 256 in saline , 1 : 512 in albumin and 1 : 1024 by the indirect Coombs test .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition one serum was obtained from a donor ( R. E. . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">who had been sensitized 6 years previously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This serum exhibited titers of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect Coombs test .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous * * f red cells .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anti - A and anti - B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2 % suspension of group * * f or group B red cells in a small * * f test tube .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect Coombs techniques .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Homozygous and heterozygous * * f cells , * * f and homozygous and heterozygous * * f cells were used to test each sample ; however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous * * f and homozygous * * f cells will be presented here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37 ` C before centrifugation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The cells were washed three times with saline , anti human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for used in the present study .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The red cells for the Rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the * * f cells , which had been glycerolized and stored at - 20 ` C for approximately 1 year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These cells were thawed at 37 ` C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2 % ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2 % in saline .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes , approximately 750 ml each , of `` starting buffer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This buffer , pH 8.6 , was 0.005 M in * * f and 0.039 M in tris ( hydroxymethyl ) - aminomethane ( Tris ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a * * f cm column of DEAE-cellulose equilibrated with starting buffer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The DEAE-cellulose , containing 0.78 mEq of N / g , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - 230 mesh .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the end of the run , the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried , stained for 1 hr , washed and dried , while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at 1 ` C .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The unstained strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The strip sections containing a given protein were pooled , eluted with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluates were tested for antibody activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate buffered saline , pH 7.2 , ionic strength 0.154 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were then centrifuged at 59780 rpm for 35 to 80 min at 20 ` C in a Spinco model E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25 % .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sedimentation coefficients were computed as * * f values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the Schlieren patterns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For preparative ultracentrifugation , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ultracentrifugation was then carried out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being used throughout the run .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Successive 1 - ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other methods will be described below .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood group of the donor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With either of the gradients described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at least three regions ( Figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">1 and 2 ) :
one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These have been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">2 or by allowing the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P. J. and R. S. , Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">1 and E. M. , Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">2 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak ( Region 1a ) between Regions 1 and 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">1 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a ( donors P. J. , D. A. , and J. F. , Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">1 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity , as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In all cases , most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti - A and anti - B activity in group O serum , though in two group O donors ( J. F. and E. M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">1 and 2 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Several samples of citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn et al .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group AB plasma as a control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As expected , most of the activity was found in Fraction * * f , with slight activity seen in Fraction 4 , - 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A sample of Fraction * * f from group O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer , dialyzed against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once again , both anti - A and anti - B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Similarly , both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the chromatographic eluate , having extremely low , low , and high anionic binding capacity , respectively ( Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">3 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram ; the complete , in the latter part .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">1 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In all cases the activity against * * f cells was spread over a wider area than that with * * f cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect Coombs ) used for comparison .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact agglutination of * * f cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing `` only '' incomplete antibody activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apart from the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50 ` F and there is not too much wind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of flies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is a happy , buzzing crowd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , black tipped little scale .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By scrutinizing the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Those are the nectaries or honey glands ( Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">26 , page 74 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The staminate willow catkins , then , provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen ; a marvelous arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I will deal with these later on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Quite often , honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As we have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them Bombus ; there must be several dozen species in the United States alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North American species is Bumblebees and Their Ways by O. E. Plath .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As befits a queen , a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such as a deserted mouse nest , a bird house , or the hole made by a woodpecker ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once she has made up her mind , the queen starts out by constructing , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On this , she builds an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen and nectar mixture called beebread .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen , taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the larvae hatch , they feed on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She continues to add to the pollen supply as needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The larvae , kept warm by the queen , are full grown in about ten days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After another two weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees , collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs ; males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By the middle of the summer , many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens begin to appear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Simultaneously , males or drones are produced , mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing , for instance , in August .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The temperature then is still very high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die out completely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The nest itself , the structure that in some cases housed about 2000 individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo bumblebee '' as it is called in some European countries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets - naturally !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Later on , they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Worse still , in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills off the Bombus queen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkins in the spring ; there are other wild bees that command our attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is almost certain that some of these , usually a trifle smaller than the honeybees , are andrenas or mining bees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One of my favorites is A. armata , a species very common in England , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns , where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Almost equal in size to a honeybee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A. armata is much more beautiful in color , at least in the female of the species : a rich , velvety , rusty red .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The males are much duller .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After having mated , an Andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground , forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or `` cells '' , each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their appearance , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the Sacramento valley in California , for instance , it has been observed that there was not one day 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This must be due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although Andrena is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After all , social life in the group of the bees is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the basis of its life history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great Plains , for example , in Utah and central Washington .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the United States Department of Agriculture 's Yearbook of Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George E. Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Often the burrows are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer , and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In most places , there are two generations a year , a second brood of adults appearing late in the summer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington , but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and Prosser in July or August , when the bees are in their most active period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The name `` alkali bee '' indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes , although by no means always , these are indeed alkaline .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist ; yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They dislike dense vegetation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where does one find such conditions ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The best chance , of course , is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Laurence M .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Carpenter 's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Additional records of slow growth have been omitted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When it comes to rate of early growth , the Indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years , more or less .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The African rock python , a close second , is followed in turn by the reticulate python .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are few data on the boa constrictor , those for the anaconda are unconvincing , and there is nothing at all on the amethystine python .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seems likely that the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an overestimation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The best way to determine the correct figure ( in captives ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : maturing of a male Indian python in less than two years , his mate in less than three ; data on the boa constrictor about match this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations :
about three years are required , there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Only the amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less than a 10 - foot maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oliver , in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers , which I shall consider separately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These three were much alike : lined snake ( Tropidoclonion ) , one year and nine months ; red-bellied snake ( Storeria ) , two years ; cottonmouth ( Ancistrodon ) , two years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Klauber investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He concluded that in the southern species , which are rapidly growing types , females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other herpetologists have ascertained that in the northern United States the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old , and that the young may be born every other year , rather than annually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Carpenter 's study showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Measurements of skins are of little value ; every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In spite of all the pitfalls , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment , but the reason for this is not clear ; the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical South America might be responsible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are three levels on which to treat the subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This approach rejects virtually all field measurements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected , and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The argument against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards ; the mere piling up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop snakes , joint snakes , or ghosts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oliver has recently used the second level approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions :
the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet , the reticulate python 33 , the African rock python 25 , the amethystine python at least 22 , the Indian python 20 , and the boa constrictor 18 - 1 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bernard Heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He reasons that as anacondas 30 feet long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freaks '' over 50 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength , but these seem to be given to complete his picture , not to be believed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Discussions of the giants one by one will include , as far as possible , data on these aspects of growth :
size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; time required to reach maturity ; rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of Oliver 's figures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Definite information on the growth of senile individuals is lacking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At birth , this species varies considerably in size .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield Zoo , near Chicago , ranged in length from 22 to 33 - 1 2 inches and averaged 29 inches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lawrence E .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Griffin gives measurements of nineteen young anacondas , presumably members of a brood , from `` South America '' ; the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the Brookfield brood and its average .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Raymond L .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ditmars had two broods that averaged 27 inches .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">William Beebe reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces ( this snake must have been emaciated ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British Guiana .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In contrast , Ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two young of a 19 - foot female as 38 inches , and four young were born in London at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beebe had a 3 - foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have little information on the anaconda 's rate of growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hans Schweizer had one that increased from 19 - 1 2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and J .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">J .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Quelch records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1948 , Afranio do Amaral , the noted Brazilian herpetologist , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He concluded that the anaconda 's maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet ( 14 meters is slightly less that 46 feet ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Thus , his estimate lies between Oliver 's suggestion of at least 37 feet and the 50 - foot `` monstrous freaks '' intimated by Heuvelmans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon , a petroleum geologist of the Richmond Oil Company , and reported in 1944 by Emmett R .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dunn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However , as a field measurement , it is open to question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oliver 's 37 - 1 2 feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A Colombian female 's brood of sixteen boa constrictors born in the Staten Island Zoo averaged 20 inches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This birth length seems to be typical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The range is from 14 to 25 inches ; the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a Central American female ( see chapter on Laying , Brooding , Hatching , and Birth ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes , these data must be taken tentatively ; final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alphonse R .</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hoge 's measurements of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Carl Kauffeld has written to me of sexual activity in February 1943 of young born in March 1940 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One female , collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua , was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The female from Central America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; unfortunately , no one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period of time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The results are too varied to allow generalization .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">8 , 22 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another marked difference is noted here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">8 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles - terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No bronchial artery pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lung type 3 , ( fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">3 ) is to some degree a composite of types 1 , and 2 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules ; well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septa and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura ( fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">9 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles ( figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">14 , 15 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Air drifts from one area to another are , therefore , conceivable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type 1 , ( fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">24 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This relationship , however , is not maintained centrally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here the pulmonary vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">23 , 24 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As seen in types 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the hilar lymph nodes , vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein , the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As in type 1 , , it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen ( figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">9 , 10 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With completion of filling , net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum ( figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">16 , 23 , 24 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This vessel could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed ( figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">17 , 18 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; through the interlobular septa ; and along the terminal bronchiole ( figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">14 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One bronchial arteriolar pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level ( fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">26 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; and , in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van Allen and Lindskog , ' 31 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 , and 3 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , ' 54 ) in the human being .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As early as 1858 , Le Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The opposition to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller ( ' 50 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Apparently , however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal study ( Loosli , ' 38 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat ( Miller , ' 13 ; ' 25 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , ' 58 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The presence of normally occurring bronchial artery pulmonary artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nakamura ( ' 58 ) , Verloop ( ' 48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( ' 50 ) , von Hayek ( ' 53 ) , and Tobin ( ' 52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Miller ( ' 50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In criticism of the latter 's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Our own studies in which bronchial artery pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This viewpoint is further supported by Verloop 's ( ' 48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other words , the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery pulmonary artery anastomoses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Verloop ( ' 48 ; ' 49 ) found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ellis , Grindlay and Edwards ( ' 52 ) also were unable to find them in rats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nakamura ( ' 58 ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic methods , in dogs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species dependent is therefore inferred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is , however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery pulmonary artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lungs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition , a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also , for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences from man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally , it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Type 1 , is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; type 3 , , by the horse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lobularity is extremely well developed in type 1 , ; absent in type 2 , ; imperfectly developed in type 3 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pleura and interlobular septa are thick in types 1 , and 3 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pleura is extremely thin in type 2 , and septa are absent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arterial supply to the pleura in types 1 , and 3 , is provided by the bronchial artery , and in type 2 , , by the pulmonary artery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In types 1 , , 2 , and 3 , the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In type 3 , the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types 1 , and 3 , , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well developed respiratory bronchioles , on the other hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In type 1 , the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This maybe due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In type 3 , this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines are based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the lower portion of each Chart , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation , and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , a child 's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity Chart : each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting of those from Hand , Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , and Foot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round bones of the five regions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly , since only two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Third , the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset and Completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fourth , the two indicators are for the most part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as well as Hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The data for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 , and for girl 2 in Figure 4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The numbering system used in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The `` dot '' on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child 's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The `` tip '' of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child 's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , the alignment of the `` dots '' and `` tips '' , respectively , indicate individual variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the `` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification used in this paper is `` same schedule '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset , and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The difference between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in Figures 3 and 4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This difference is readily clarified by referring to Table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example , arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the boy , this epiphysis was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center 's ability to `` catch up '' in ossification is demonstrated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In contrast , for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset and delayed at Completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Obviously , the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Skeletal Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Length of the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in Table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have attempted to simplify the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each child - more than 1700 values for the entire group - by constructing figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for each growth center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the Appendix .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The principles used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One growth center in a short bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the top of Figure 5 , for example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in Table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The 34 arrows , denoting onset age plus completion age deviations , have been arrayed in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The growth center depicted here , in the distal phalanx of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The mean onset age was 25.3 months ( Table 1 ) , and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The correlation ( Table 2 ) between onset age and completion age was + .50 , and that between onset age and Span was - .10 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing , expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years , and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement , each arrow with a `` shaft length '' of four months or less was selected as indicating `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion , for this particular epiphysis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Accordingly , girls 31 , 29 , 33 , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , 32 , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Accordingly , if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Boys 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Boy 34 , like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The `` dot '' on his arrow indicates early Onset and the `` tip '' indicates relatively later Completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After the 42 figures had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6 , classifications of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Interestingly enough , the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to * * f and then to * * f as the active iodinating species .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Iodination of tyrosine , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mono - and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine analogues ( Pitt-Rivers and James , 1958 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The chemical nature of the iodocompounds is discussed below ( pp.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">76 et seq. ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in vitro been unequivocally proven .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments ( Wolff , Robbins and Rall , 1959 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Similar findings have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition , depending on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before secretion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One of the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan , Stanley and Trikojus , 1954 ; Alpers , Robbins and Rall , 1955 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid glands from TSH treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in vivo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates ( Alpers , Petermann and Rall , 1956 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A microsomal de-iodinase with a pH optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity , has been identified in the thyroid ( Stanbury , 1957 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This de-iodinating enzyme is effective against mono - and di-iodotyrosine , but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is assumed that the iodine released from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid , where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has been shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has been suggested that the plasma thyroxine binding proteins , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( Ingbar and Freinkel , 1957 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Antithyroid drugs are of two general types .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate perchlorate fluoroboride type .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism , but they inhibit organification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( Astwood , 1954 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , there are a few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Any of the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of TSH , causing the thyroid to enlarge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The effect of drugs that act on the iodide concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonised by such means .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types , certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The most conclusively identified is L - 5 - vinyl - 2 - thio oxazolidone , which was isolated from rutabaga ( Greer , 1950 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre , particularly in Tasmania and Australia ( Clements and Wishart , 1956 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen , which is then secreted in the milk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid gland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; Stanbury , Brownell , Riggs , Perinetti , Itoiz , and Del Castillo , 1954 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 | mg per day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With lower levels , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Further , the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the presence of a low iodine intake , thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with * * f is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal , the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the deficiency persists long enough , it is reasonable to suppose that the * * f label will reflect the * * f distribution in the thyroglobulin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The name thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so far tested for its presence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Brown ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce ( 1851 ) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid .
.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This connection was clarified by Smith and Smith ( 1922 ) , who showed that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later , when Janssen and Loeser ( 1931 ) used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After their work other investigators applied salt fractionation techniques to the problem , as well as fractionation with organic solvents , such as acetone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Albert ( 1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period , from 1931 to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Much of this work has been reviewed by White ( 1944 ) and by Albert ( 1949 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Developments up to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg ( 1958 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the last few years , the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification ( Bates and Condliffe , 1960 ; Pierce , Carsten and Wynston , 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in potency , composition and physical properties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First , is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second , what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed rationally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary TSH .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The introduction of the United States Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We should like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the most part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The international unit ( u . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">, adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories ( Mussett and Perry , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International Standard Preparation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The international unit is equipotent with the USP unit adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the USP reference substance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition , the neocortical hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should be added that in man neocortical hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After this brief discussion of neo - , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations , let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Facilitatory processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Apparently , a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obviously , a vicious cycle develops .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Before we comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs , the latter the tranquilizers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as , for instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Important as these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depressions , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and , eventually , maniclike changes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The emotional states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner ; synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive drugs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl test .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore , conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If , for instance , such a change is produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned reactions reappear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the EEG .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If this is the case , one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wolpe 's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned ) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An important observation of Pavlov served as a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In a conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The pain became thus the symbol for food and elicited salivary secretion ( conditioned reflex ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The feeding pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho - and ergotropic systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different autonomic somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines , the state of the muscle tone , and the Mecholyl test .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The psychological incompatibility of these emotional states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic cortical discharge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic cortical discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What can we do with the general T ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second , even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V ; this is clearly a deficiency in T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The second situation is illustrated by the operator T on * * f ( F any field ) represented in the standard basis by * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The characteristic polynomial for A is * * f and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus T is not diagonalizable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One sees that this happens because the null space of * * f has dimension 1 only .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , the null space of * * f and the null space of * * f together span V , the former being the subspace spanned by * * f and the latter the subspace spanned by * * f and * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This will be more or less our general method for the second problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If ( remember this is an assumption ) the minimal polynomial for T decomposes * * f where * * f are distinct elements of F , then we shall show that the space V is the direct sum of the null spaces of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which * * f for each i .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The theorem which we prove is more general than what we have described , since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the primes which enter are all of first degree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reader will find it helpful to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think of the proof of Theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let T be a linear operator on the finite dimensional vector space V over the field F .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then ( a ) * * f ( b ) each * * f is invariant under T ( c ) if * * f is the operator induced on * * f by T , then the minimal polynomial for * * f is * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The idea of the proof is this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the direct sum decomposition ( a ) is valid , how can we get hold of the projections * * f associated with the decomposition ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The projection * * f will be the identity on * * f and zero on the other * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We shall find a polynomial * * f such that * * f is the identity on * * f and is zero on the other * * f , and so that * * f , etc. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For each i , let * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since * * f are distinct prime polynomials , the polynomials * * f are relatively prime ( Theorem 8 , Chapter 4 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus there are polynomials * * f such that * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Note also that if * * f , then * * f is divisible by the polynomial p , because * * f contains each * * f as a factor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We shall show that the polynomials * * f behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of the proof .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since * * f and p divides * * f for * * f , we have * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus the * * f are projections which correspond to some direct sum decomposition of the space V .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We wish to show that the range of * * f is exactly the subspace * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is clear that each vector in the range of * * f is in * * f for if |a is in the range of * * f , then * * f and so * * f because * * f is divisible by the minimal polynomial p .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Conversely , suppose that |a is in the null space of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If * * f , then * * f is divisible by * * f and so * * f , i.e. , * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But then it is immediate that * * f , i.e. , that |a is in the range of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This completes the proof of statement ( a ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is certainly clear that the subspaces * * f are invariant under T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If * * f is the operator induced on * * f by T , then evidently * * f , because by definition * * f is 0 on the subspace * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This shows that the minimal polynomial for * * f divides * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Conversely , let g be any polynomial such that * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus * * f is divisible by the minimal polynomial p of T , i.e. , * * f divides * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is easily seen that * * f divides g .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hence the minimal polynomial for * * f is * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If * * f are the projections associated with the primary decomposition of T , then each * * f is a polynomial in T , and accordingly if a linear operator U commutes with T then U commutes with each of the * * f i.e. , each subspace * * f is invariant under U .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the notation of the proof of Theorem 12 , let us take a look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for T is a product of first degree polynomials , i.e. , the case in which each * * f is of the form * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now the range of * * f is the null space * * f of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let us put * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By Theorem 10 , D is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let us look at the operator * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now * * f * * f so * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The reader should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that * * f and in general that * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When * * f for each i , we shall have * * f , because the operator * * f will then be 0 on the range of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let N be a linear operator on the vector space V .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We say that N is nilpotent if there is some positive integer r such that * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let T be a linear operator on the finite dimensional vector space V over the field F .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Suppose that the minimal polynomial for T decomposes over F into a product of linear polynomials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then there is a diagonalizable operator D on V and a nilpotent operator N on V such that ( a ) * * f , ( b ) * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The diagonalizable operator D and the nilpotent operator N are uniquely determined by ( a ) and ( b ) and each of them is a polynomial in T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We have just observed that we can write * * f where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent , and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials in T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now suppose that we also have * * f where D ' is diagonalizable , N ' is nilpotent , and * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We shall prove that * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since D ' and N ' commute with one another and * * f , we see that D ' and N ' commute with T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus D ' and N ' commute with any polynomial in T ; hence they commute with D and with N .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now we have * * f or * * f and all four of these operators commute with one another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since D and D ' are both diagonalizable and they commute , they are simultaneously diagonalizable , and * * f is diagonalizable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since N and N ' are both nilpotent and they commute , the operator * * f is nilpotent ; for , using the fact that N and N ' commute * * f and so when r is sufficiently large every term in this expression for * * f will be 0 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( Actually , a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its nth power 0 ; if we take * * f above , that will be large enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It then follows that * * f is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now * * f is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Such an operator is obviously the zero operator ; for since it is nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form * * f for some * * f ; but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; hence * * f and the minimal polynomial is simply x , which says the operator is 0 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus we see that * * f and * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field F , e.g. , the field of complex numbers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then every linear operator T on V can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator D and a nilpotent operator N which commute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These operators D and N are unique and each is a polynomial in T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From these results , one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For vector spaces over non algebraically closed fields , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In concluding this section , we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear algebra .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the primary decomposition theorem , it is not necessary that the vector space V be finite dimensional , nor is it necessary for parts ( a ) and ( b ) that p be the minimal polynomial for T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If T is a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a monic polynomial p such that * * f , then parts ( a ) and ( b ) of Theorem 12 are valid for T with the proof which we gave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let n be a positive integer and let V be the space of all n times continuously differentiable functions f on the real line which satisfy the differential equation * * f where * * f are some fixed constants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If * * f denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable functions , then the space V of solutions of this differential equation is a subspace of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If D denotes the differentiation operator and p is the polynomial * * f then V is the null space of the operator p ( D ) , because * * f simply says * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let us now regard D as a linear operator on the subspace V .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we are discussing differentiable complex valued functions , then * * f and V are complex vector spaces , and * * f may be any complex numbers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We now write * * f where * * f are distinct complex numbers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If * * f is the null space of * * f , then Theorem 12 says that * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In other words , if f satisfies the differential equation * * f , then f is uniquely expressible in the form * * f where * * f satisfies the differential equation * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , the study of the solutions to the equation * * f is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra , i.e. , by the primary decomposition theorem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To describe the space of solutions to * * f , one must know something about differential equations , that is , one must know something about D other than the fact that it is a linear operator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , one does not need to know very much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is very easy to establish by induction on r that if f is in * * f then * * f that is , * * f , etc. .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A function g such that * * f , i.e. , * * f , must be a polynomial function of degree * * f or less : * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus f satisfies * * f if and only if f has the form * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Accordingly , the ' functions ' * * f span the space of solutions of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since * * f are linearly independent functions and the exponential function has no zeros , these r functions * * f , form a basis for the space of solutions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When three dice are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of aces is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More generally , suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` non success '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the examples above , the occurrence of a bull's-eye , a straight haired mouse , or an ace could be called a `` success '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In general , any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The major question in this chapter is : What is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In Chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples , usually by counting points in a sample space .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the marksmanship example , a trial consists of `` one round shot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's-eye ( success ) or none ( failure ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further , an experiment might consist of five rounds , and several sets of five rounds might be regarded as a super experiment composed of several repetitions of the five round experiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If three dice are tossed , a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or , what amounts to the same thing , if one die is tossed three times , each toss is a trial , and the three tosses form the experiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mathematically , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These examples are illustrative of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each Friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Considering only these Fridays , what is the probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Exactly 2 times ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">1 time ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">0 time ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Note that there are 3 trials of interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each trial consists of choosing a student manager at random .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The 2 possible outcomes on each trial are `` driver '' or `` nondriver '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since the choice is by lot each week , the outcomes of different trials are independent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The managers stay the same , so that * * f is the same for all weeks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We also give , for each property , an example where the property is absent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The language and notation introduced are standard throughout the chapter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the marksman , we study sets of five shots ( * * f ) ; for the mice , we restrict attention to litters of eight ( * * f ) ; and for the aces , we toss three dice ( * * f ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Toss a die until an ace appears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here the number of trials is a random variable , not a fixed number .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each of the n trials is either a success or a failure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial trials in general .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These words are more expressive than labels like `` A '' and `` not - A '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is natural from the marksman 's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both usages apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms p and * * f that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` not ace '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We classify mice as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse appears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the animal as not constituting a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each die has probability * * f of producing an ace ; the marksman has some probability p , perhaps 0.1 , of making a bull's-eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman , lowering his chance of a bull's-eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Strictly speaking , this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus in the three dice example * * f , * * f , and the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three dice fall ace , not ace , ace in that order is ( 1 6 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 1 6 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Experimentally , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A family of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains , and a coin is tossed to decide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We want to know the number of people going to the mountains .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials , one for each member of the family , the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Indeed , the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following is a less extreme example of dependence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider couples visiting an art museum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Voting for one picture may be called `` success '' , for the other `` failure '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An experiment consists of the voting of one couple , or two trials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In repetitions of the experiment from couple to couple , the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply , because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Table 7 - 1 illustrates the point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The table shows that 0.6 of the boys and 0.6 of the girls vote for picture A .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore , under independent voting , * * f or 0.36 of the couples would cast two votes for picture A , and * * f or 0.16 would cast two votes for picture B .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus in independent voting , * * f or 0.52 of the couples would agree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Table 7 - 1 shows that * * f or 0.70 agree , too many for independent voting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each performance of an n-trial binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 through n as the value of the random variable X , where * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We want to study the probability function of this random variable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example , we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes , not which shots were bull's-eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example , the marksman gets 5 shots , but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bull's-eye , that is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he gets no bull's-eye ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random variable is not the number of successes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Obviously , very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( For instance , see Example 2 of Section 5 - 5 , on red cards in hands of 5 . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; that is , we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its departures from the binomial model .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A binomial experiment consists of * * f independent binomial trials , all with the same probability * * f of yielding a success .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The outcome of the experiment is X successes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The random variable X takes the values * * f with probabilities * * f or , more briefly * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When each number of successes x is paired with its probability of occurrence * * f , the set of pairs * * f , is a probability function called a binomial distribution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The choice of p and n determines the binomial distribution uniquely , and different choices always produce different distributions ( except when * * f ; then the number of successes is always 0 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The set of all binomial distributions is called the family of binomial distributions , but in general discussions this expression is often shortened to `` the binomial distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Binomial distributions were treated by James Bernoulli about 1700 , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called Bernoulli trials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore each binomial trial can be thought of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities q and p respectively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable X , the total number of successes , which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The marksman gets two bull's-eyes , one on his third shot and one on his fifth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The numbers of successes on the five individual shots are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 , and there are 5 such random variables here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their sum is X , the total number of successes , which in this experiment has the value * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are real analytic periodic functions with period T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in **f there are families of such cubes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed , the spiral **f , with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The square has one corner point on the straight line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On C , from the point P at **f to the point Q at **f , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as s approaches zero the square is inside C .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As s increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , **f and **f , adjacent to P and Q respectively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As s approaches T the square will be outside C and therefore both **f and **f must cross C an odd number of times as s varies from zero to T .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The points may also touch C without crossing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Suppose **f crosses C when **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We now have certain squares with three corners on C .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the diagonal point of the square .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each point on C , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To each paired vertex and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing t .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the vertex is at **f , and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90 ` about the vertex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The set of intersections of **f , the rotated curve , with the original curve C consists of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at **f , plus the vertex itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We note that two such curves C and **f , cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points ; otherwise , being analytic , they would coincide at all points , which is impossible since they do not coincide near **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With each vertex we associate certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the parameter t between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For the vertex at **f , these values will be denoted by **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The function f ( t ) defined in this way is multi valued .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We consider now the graph of the function f ( t ) on **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We will refer to the plane of C and **f as the C-plane and to the plane of the graph as the f-plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The graph , as a set , may have a finite number of components .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We will denote the values of f ( t ) on different components by **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection between C and **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are two types of such intersections , depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An ordinary point will be any point of intersection A such that in every neighborhood of A in the C-plane , **f meets both the interior and the exterior of C .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Any other point of intersection between C and **f will be called a tangent point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the f-plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We can now prove several lemmas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function f is a single valued , continuous function .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We first show that the function is single valued in some neighborhood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the vertex at **f in the C-plane we assume that **f is the parametric location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We know that in the C-plane both C and **f are analytic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the C-plane we construct a set of rectangular Cartesian coordinates u , v with the origin at Q and such that both C and **f have finite slope at Q .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Near Q , both curves can be represented by analytic functions of u .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single valued , analytic function of u .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore , one can find a neighborhood of Q in which the difference function is monotone , for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now , to find **f , one needs the intersection of C and **f near Q .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But **f is just the curve **f translated without rotation through a small arc , for **f is always obtained by rotating C through exactly 90 ` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus if e is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and **f near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every e then the difference between C and **f near Q would not be a monotone function .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore , **f is single valued near Q .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is also seen that **f , since the change from **f to **f is accomplished by a continuous translation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus **f is also continuous at **f , and in a neighborhood of **f which does not contain a tangent point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and **f are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say **f , the function **f is either double valued or has no values defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is single valued .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and **f are tangent to one another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A continuous change in t through an amount e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are three possibilities : ( a ) **f remains tangent to C as it is translated ; ( b ) **f moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for **f ; ( c ) **f cuts across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every t in **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the f-plane , the end points of which fall into category ( b ) or ( c ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the second category the function **f has no values defined in a neighborhood **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the third category the function is double valued in this interval .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Again , the analyticity of the two curves guarantee that such intervals exist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two valued or no valued on one side , and is a single valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First , for any value of t for which all values of f ( t ) are ordinary points the number of values of f ( t ) must be odd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and **f must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of C , **f could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at t is the argument of the function , not a value .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , for any value of t the number of values of f ( t ) is equal to the ( finite ) number of tangent points corresponding to the argument t plus an odd number .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The number of ordinary values of the function f ( t ) at t will be called its multiplicity at t .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval [ 0 , T ] .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We suppose not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then every component of the graph of f must be defined over a bounded sub-interval .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Suppose **f is defined in the sub-interval **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now **f and **f must both be tangent points on the nth component in the f-plane ; otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further , we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of f can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even integer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus the multiplicity of **f for a given t must be an even number .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is true of all components which have such a bounded support .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But this is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f ( t ) is odd for every t .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have shown that the graph of f contains at least one component whose inverse is the entire interval [ 0 , T ] , and whose multiplicity is odd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There must be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The remaining ( incomplete ) components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument , and are defined only on a proper sub-interval of [ 0 , T ] .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the C-plane are on opposite sides of C .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We again consider a fixed point P at **f and a variable point Q at **f on C .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We erect a square with PQ as a side and with free corners **f and **f adjacent to P and Q respectively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As s varies from zero to T , the values of s for which **f and **f cross C will be denoted by **f and **f respectively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have **f , plus tangent points .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These s-values are just the ordinary values of **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The values **f are the ordinary values at **f of a multi valued function g ( t ) which has components corresponding to those of f ( t ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We first define a function b ( t ) as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at t , b ( t ) is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between t and the backward corner points .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The functions f and b have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument t .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now with P fixed at **f , **f-values occur when the corner **f crosses C , and are among the values of s such that **f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The roots of this equation are just the ordinates of the intersections of the graph of b with a straight line of unit slope through **f in the b-plane ( the plane of the graph of b ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We define these values as **f , and define g ( t ) in the same way for each t .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus we obtain g ( t ) by introducing an oblique g ( t ) - axis in the b-plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These societies can expect to face difficult times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">National leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Feelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated - in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time - on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At the same time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we look at countries like Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The men in power are committed in principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communications between the two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefits of modern life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Above all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible for their fates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">With respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above all , how progress in each field relates to national progress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Efforts such as the Community Development Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To achieve this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If modernization programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As an isolated policy , land reform is likely to be politically disruptive ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Land reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lastly , governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By holding out prospects for external capital assistance , the United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the economic front , the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Several related tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These countries must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They must in their planning be able to count on at least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally , a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural surpluses , and general balance of payments support .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For one thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects ; even the famed Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Technical assistance in training middle - and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are also more basic problems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless , impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Another great danger is that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Particularly when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period of time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the exception of treaty making , foreign relations were historically concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Foreign policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">American and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition ; but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social structure which each society must generate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy , especially in the context of economic aid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are several closely related inner functions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man 's deepest experience - the religious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Man is first religious ; the instrumentalities follow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation , self pacification , and self completion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The chief experience is the sensing of communion , and in the higher religions , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Man has the experience of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand ; he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The universe is a safe and permanent home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance ; man has a second chance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is not lost in the abyss of endless time ; he has endless being .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Religion can summate , epitomize , relate , and conserve all the highest ideals and values - ethical , aesthetic , and religious - of man formed in his culture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is also the possibility , among higher religions , of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and expansiveness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The kind of religious experience that most moderns seek not only provides , clarifies , and relates human yearnings , values , ideals , and purposes ; it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under the religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , men have joy in living ; life leads somewhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Religion at its best is out in front , ever beckoning and leading on , and , as Lippman put it , `` mobilizing all man 's scattered energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the same time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It gives him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is confronted with the recurrent crises , such as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old age , the certainty of death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His religious beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible fortitude , equanimity , and consolation , enabling him to endure colossal misfortune , fear , frustration , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here and now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The two have never been separable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even in the united states , with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere ; for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In America also all of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even the non church members - the freewheelers , marginal religionists and so on - have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally , it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It places certain values at least beyond questioning and tampering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends ; for example , a plan that fulfills the will of God , which advances the Kingdom of God , which involves social life as part of the Grand Design .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally , it gives meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In general , there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Religion integrates and unifies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some of the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These groups have varied widely from mere families , primitive , totemic groups , and small modern cults and sects , to the memberships of great denominations , and great , widely dispersed world religions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Religion fosters group life in various ways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The common ultimate values , ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Without a system of values there can be no society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where such a value system prevails , it always unifies all who possess it ; it enables members of the society to operate as a system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in creeds , dogmas , and doctrines , and form what Durkheim calls a credo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As he points out , a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo , and the more extensive the credo , the more unified and strong is the group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firmer the group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The religious symbolism , and especially the closely related rites and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The religion , in fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The common codes , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Durkheim noted long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or inter people religion are cases in point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">it might be pointed out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Religion usually exercises a stabilizing conserving function .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As such it acts as an anchor for the people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As Yinger has pointed out , the `` reliance on symbols , on tradition , on sacred writings , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Historically , religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the same time that religion exercises a conserving influence , it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force , mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices ; for example , the Crusades , mission efforts , just wars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Religion provides the most attractive rewards , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide by its norms , but who engage in good works .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control , enforcing what men should or should not do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group ; and in modern societies such influence is still great .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Religion has its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A third aspect , and probably the one open to most controversy , is the results of the election .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were stressed in the speeches of Si Mubarak Bekkai when the first Council of Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">King Muhammad /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May Day , 1957 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister of the Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Until the Charter of Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti Democratique de l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil service and influence in Radio Maroc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There were rumors that the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In January , 1958 , the Minister of the Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council of Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The parties were on the whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after effects of poor harvests in 1957 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity '' of the Balafrej Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign policy , labor politics and economic development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By December , 1958 , when ' Abdallah Ibrahim became President of the Council , elections had even greater importance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new , constructive national effort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority parties , such as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for elections when out of power , but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At the central level the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form of the scrutin de liste system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political parties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both parties and the Ministry of the Interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber of Commerce elections , which took place three weeks before national elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union Marocaine des Commercants , Industrialistes et Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union National des Forces Populaires ) in nearly all urban centers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor based U.N.F.P.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table /1 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The chamber of Commerce elections were , of course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on U.M.T. support , was most effective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although a somewhat technical subject , it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore , the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The sine qua non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The P.D.I. and later the Popular Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bulk of the preparation had , of course , proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior , whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Apart from some areas of recurring trouble , like Bani Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Centrally , however , the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council of Government under his personal direction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance , his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P. members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P.
Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A goal was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused on its fulfillment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The qualifications to vote were kept very simple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both men and women of twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens , criminals and those punished for Protectorate activities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit of a reliable census .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But neither was the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is the course the positivists took .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They explained value judgments by explaining them away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now I do not think their view will do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But before discussing it , I should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has been said of John Stuart Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The theory claims to show by analysis that when we say , `` That is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I shall argue that we do mean to do just that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let us work through an example , and the simpler and commoner the better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There is perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let us take a set of circumstances in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger , pain , and fear , it has all but eaten off its own leg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The attempt failed : the animal is now dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As we think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered , we are very likely to say : `` It was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I hold , on the contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it was bad - bad when and as it occurred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consider what follows from the positivist view .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On that view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came on the scene and made my remark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For what I express in my remark is something going on in me at the time , and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad ; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involved at all , waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clearly not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Indeed we should say , on the contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal 's pain , that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If so , then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds it should be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The second argument applies the method in the reverse way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It ideally removes the past event , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds it should not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the only sense in which badness is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And our question is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clearly it is not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seems to me merely frivolous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the theory before us , such relief would be groundless , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all , and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So far as I can see , there is only one way out for the positivist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The pain in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at all , took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so far as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The pathetic evidence is no longer before us ; and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is , as we say , quite dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In these circumstances , since what was expressed by the remark when first made is , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now expresses nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is as empty as the word `` Hurrah '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this seems to me untrue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing , the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point , but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before , we should certainly answer Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it was the same point we were making .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero , it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I come now to a fourth consideration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not ; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Broad and Ross have lately contended that this fitness is one of the main facts of ethics , and I suspect they are right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But that is not exactly my point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My point is this :
whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let me illustrate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In his novel The House of the Dead , Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison camp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today , Dostoevsky 's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I have heard stories '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural actions , of the most monstrous murders , told with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now on the subjectivist view , this answer is ruled out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For before someone takes up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their infliction , they have no moral quality at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are in themselves neutral , and , so far as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But if that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would applause , for example , be fitting if , apart from the applause , there were nothing good to applaud ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed we are forced to go much farther .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If there is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why should n't they be greeted with a cheer ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; it would needlessly bring badness into the world ; and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand , to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good ; it would bring goodness into the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch , as such .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations ; that is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual space '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The underlying assumption , of course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other senses being decidedly inferior , if not totally inadequate , in this regard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The force of the authors ' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( 1 ) What allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( 2 ) What evidence is there that he was psychically blind ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( 3 ) How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative , if the argument is to get under way at all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient 's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion , any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is as follows : `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as well as the kinesthetic sensations ( muscular feelings , feelings in the tendons and joints ) , were , as such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in comparison with normal reactions , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as well as the direction and scope of a movement , passively executed ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on the contrary , very considerably affected '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The authors insist , however , that these abnormalities in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( 1 ) When an object was placed in the patient 's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and so on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; that is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line of work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective visual condition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could not see objects as unified , self-contained , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The meaning of this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and so on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">According to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more or less indefinite size ; at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner , find the unseen form ; could piece , as it were , the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned out to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If , however , the figure to be discerned were complicated , composed of several interlocking subfigures , and so on , even the tracing process failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This meant , concretely , that the patient could not read at all without making writing like movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` hasher marks '' inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at all ; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After a conversation with another man , he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nor could he call up memory-pictures of close friends or relatives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In short , both his own declarations and his figural blindness , when he looked at objects , seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learned and held in visual memory , as persons of normal vision do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could not recognize it ; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he might finally recognize it , apparently by combining the visual blot , actually being seen , with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This would mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Men , trees , automobiles , houses , and so on - objects continually confronted in everyday life - had each its characteristic blot appearance and became easily recognizable , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as to what each was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dice , for example , he inferred from black dots on a white surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the dots gave them away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient 's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly , without the tracing motions , solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the blot like things which appeared in his visual experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps the very important question - What is , then , exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient 's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- has now been raised in the reader 's mind and in the following form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations , at least in regard to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How , then , do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient 's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned away from the object concerned ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at all and then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all , the following striking results occurred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whenever artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough , detailed study which it deserves , partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations , as at Argos , are only now coming to light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C.
The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this process the Minoan Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times - granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside - are correct ; but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first millennium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The focus of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While Protogeometric vases usually turn up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as it were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of its place of origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The potters of the Aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland , and in Greece itself Argive , Corinthian , Attic , Boeotian , and other Geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By 800 B.C. the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further we cannot go , for the Dark ages deserve their name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The epic poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Throughout the Dark ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood on firm ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The landscape of Greek history broadens widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century B.C. , the age of Homer 's `` rosy fingered Dawn '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Dipylon Geometric pottery of Athens and the Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek civilization ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The revolution was well under way before 700 B.C. , and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The era , however , is Janus-faced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While many tokens point forward , the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns of the Dark ages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The dominant pottery of the century was Geometric ; political organization revolved about the basileis ; trade was just beginning to expand ; the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The modern student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas ; the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era , I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On this principle of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The growing contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after 750 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early Greece ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie in the Aegean past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe Geometric .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The potters , in particular , had virtually eschewed freehand drawing , elaborate motifs , and the curving lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization , at first hesitantly in Protogeometric work , and then more confidently in the initial stages of the Geometric style .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at least on a simple plane ; it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ripe Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To the ancestral lore , however , new materials were added .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wavy lines , feather like patterns , rosettes of indefinitely floral nature , birds either singly or in stylized rows , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see Plates 11 - 12 ) - all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The rows of animals and birds , in particular , suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes , transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Plate 12 illustrates four examples , which are Ripe or Late Geometric work of common spirit but of different schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Three weeks later following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him , Cook reported .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Both Cook 's and Russell 's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On February 17 , Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While talking with Julian M. Beall , Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Suspecting an ambush , the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After spending two nights ( Wednesday and Thursday ) in Catskill , the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett Lee ranch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Half a mile below at the mouth of Salyer 's Canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A. J. Armstrong , occupied by a Mexican , his wife , and an old trapper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were three houses in Salyer 's Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and then passing down in front of the houses , thence to the Vermejo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To the west of this road was another low bluff , forty or fifty feet high , covered with scrub oak and other brush .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush , but one hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm , passing on through his body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the first reports , Russell 's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook , followed by a hail of bullets , raced towards the arroyo of Salyer 's Canyon immediately in front of him , just reaching it as his horse fell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath , Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bullets were so thick , throwing sand in his face , that he found it difficult to return the fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Noticing Russell 's horse in front of the long log building , he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight , so he began working his way down the ditch to join him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At a very shallow place , two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dropping to one knee , Cook felled one , and the other struggled off with his comrade , sending no further fire in his direction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed , he did hear shots down at the house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised , dismounted , but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him , he fell into the trapper 's arms - dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed through his head , tearing a hole two inches square on the outgoing side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Finding him dead , Cook caught Russell 's horse and rode to the cattle foreman 's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before daylight Sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco Chaves , where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">MacPherson boldly approached the fortified adobe house and demanded entrance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The officer demanded the names of the injured men ; the Mexicans not only refused to give them , but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants , MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The posse 's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be overbearing and impudent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; some buildings , farm tools , two horses , plows , and hay owned by Bonito Lavato , a friendly interpreter for the company , and Pedro Chavez ' hay were stolen or destroyed ; and a store was broken into and robbed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">District Attorney M. W. Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms - he just did n't catch anyone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New Mexico .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense , perpetuating the troubles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">By early summer , he wrote from Laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad way financially , so Pels sent him a draft for $ 100 , warning that it was still not wise for him to return .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pels also sent a check for $ 100 to Russell 's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cattle stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing position .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property , thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the Vermejo , and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the law virtually ignored the situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The judge became ill just as the Colfax District Court convened , no substitute was brought in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried , and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual three weeks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pels complained :
`` Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business ; public money spent ; justice delayed ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was Manuel Gonzales , a man with many followers , including a number who were kept in line through fear of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named Asher Jones , the warrant for his arrest had never been served .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On May 19 , a deputy sheriff 's posse of eight men left Maxwell City and rode thirty-five miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan Jose Martinez .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By 3 : 00 A.M. they reached his house and found it vacant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When they were refused entrance to his brother 's house nearby , they smashed down the door , broke the window , and threw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Still there was no Gonzales and the family would say nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">About 300 yards up the creek was a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While prowling around these buildings , two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He was promised that no harm would befall him if he would come out , but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Again he refused .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In deadly earnest , the besiegers methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside , only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer , taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside , square against the muzzle of a Winchester .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Shot near the heart , he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away , three bullets following him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As he pushed open the door he fell on his face , one of his comrades pulling him inside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not realizing the seriousness of the wound , the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Receiving no answer , they set the fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the house was about half consumed , his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands , declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of Manuel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finding it true that he was not inside , the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Shot six or eight times the body was draped with Russell 's pistol , belt , and cartridges .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who , though numbering in the fifties , had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Early the next morning , a Mexican telephoned Pels that Celso Chavez , one of the posse members , was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father 's home on the upper Vermejo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sheriff and District Attorney Mills hastily swore out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed , according to signed statements by Chavez and Dr. I. P. George , and ordered Deputy Barney Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Traveling all night , Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills , disappearing at the posse 's approach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A Mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against Chavez for taking part in the `` murder '' of Manuel Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The men helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton along with three other families desiring to leave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The ten or more dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large , and Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe houses , defending themselves through loopholes , it would be most difficult to capture them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus he wired J. P. Lower and Sons of Denver : `` Have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If not , how long to order and what is the price '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup , particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His problem then became one of restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean out the Vermejo by force immediately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">as new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">B. J. Connell is the present treasurer and manager .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center , Depot , and Way 's Lane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The layout of the sewer lines was designed by Henry W. Taylor , who was the engineer for the Manchester Village disposal plant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The final step was a vote for a $ 230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by the 1959 town meeting , later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town meeting June 21 , 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev. J. D. Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel F. B. Morse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At any rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1846 Matthew B. Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American Telegraph Company '' and the `` Troy and Canada Junction Telegraph Company '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shares of capital stock at $ 15 each in the latter company were payable at the Bank of Manchester or at various other Vermont banks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A message of less than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By 1871 L. C. Orvis , manager of the `` Western Union Telegraph Company '' , expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Orvis even needed to hire an assistant , Clark J. Wait .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Manchester Journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the fall of 1878 , the `` Popular Telegraph Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory Point by the owners , Paul W. Orvis , Henry Gray , J. N. Hard , and Clark J. Wait .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The line soon lived up to its name , as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital stock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1879 the same Clark Wait , with H. H. Holley of South Dorset , formed the `` American Telegraph Line '' , extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and South Dorset to Dorset .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron C. Burr and Mark Manley of `` Burr and Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry goods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But companies continued to spring up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By 1883 the `` Battenkill Telegraph Company '' was in existence and Alvin Pettibone was its president .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley Telegraph Line '' , officers of which were E. C. Orvis , president ; H. K. Fowler , vice-president and secretary ; J. N. Hard , treasurer ; F. H. Walker , superintendent ; H. S. Walker , assistant superintendent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two companies now had headquarters with Clark J. Wait , who by then had his own drugstore at Factory Point - the `` Northern Union Telegraph Company '' and the `` Western Union '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Still existing on a `` Northern Union '' telegraph form is a typical peremptory message from Peru grocer J. J. Hapgood to Burton and Graves ' store in Manchester - `` Get and send by stage sure four pounds best Porterhouse or sirloin steak , for Mrs. Hapgood send six sweet oranges '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">About 1888 J. E. McNaughton of Barnumville and E. G. Bacon became proprietors of the `` Green Mountain Telegraph Company '' , connecting all offices on the Western Union line and extending over the mountain from Barnumville to Peru , Londonderry , South Londonderry , Lowell Lake , Windham , North Windham , Grafton , Cambridgeport , Saxton 's River , and Bellows Falls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From 1896 until 1910 John H. Whipple was manager of Western Union at the Center in the drugstore he purchased from Clark Wait .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Village office of Western Union with George Towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in Hard 's drugstore until 1905 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the summers , Towsley often needed the assistance of a company operator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These were the years when people flocked to Manchester not only to play golf , which had come into vogue , but also to witness the Ekwanok Country Club tournaments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">New Yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This boosted local telegraph business and Manchester basked in all the free advertising .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1914 when the town was chosen for the U. S. Amateur Golf tournament , a representative hurried here from the Boston manager 's office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In his wake came the District Traffic Supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession , ten of Boston 's best , chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During that tournament alone , some 250000 words winged their way out of Manchester .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The old Morse system was replaced locally by the Simplex modern automatic method in 1929 , when Ellamae Heckman ( Wilcox ) was manager of the Western Union office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During summers , business was so brisk that Mrs. Wilcox had two assistants and a messenger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was succeeded by Clarence Goyette .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad station at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town clerk 's office and drugstore at the Village .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After being located for some years in the Village at the Equinox Pharmacy under the supervision of Mrs. Harry Mercier , it is presently located in the Hill and Dale Shop , Manchester Center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first known telephone line in Manchester was established in July 1883 between Burr and Manley 's store at Manchester Depot and the Kent and Root Marble Company in South Dorset .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was extended the following year to include the railroad station agent 's office and Thayer 's Hotel at Factory Point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In November 1887 a line connecting several dwelling houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester Depot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Telephone wires from Louis Dufresne 's house in East Manchester to the Dufresne lumber job near Bourn Pond were up about 1895 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eber L. Taylor of Manchester Depot recorded the setting of phone poles in East Dorset and Barnumville in his diary for 1906 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These must have been for local calls strictly , as in May 1900 the `` only long distance telephone '' in town was transferred from C. B. Carleton 's to Young 's shoe store .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A small single switchboard was installed in the Village over Woodcock 's hardware store ( later E. H. Hemenway 's ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">George Woodcock was manager and troubleshooter ; Elizabeth Way was the first operator ; and a night operator was also employed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the Manchester Journal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1918 the New England Telephone Company began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of U. S. Rte.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">7 and what is now Memorial Avenue at Manchester Center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Service running through Barnumville and to Bennington County towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the `` Gleason Telephone Company '' in 1925 , but major supervision of telephone lines in Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company , which eventually gained all control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More aerial and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1931 Mrs. F. H. Briggs , agent and chief operator , who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years ' service , led agency offices in sales for the year with $ 2490 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">William Hitchcock , who retired in 1938 , was a veteran of thirty-four years ' local service .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another veteran telephone operator was Edith Fleming Blackmer , who had been in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1932 Dorset received its own exchange , which made business easier for the Manchester office , but it was not until February 1953 that area service was extended to include Manchester and Dorset .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This eliminated toll calls between the two towns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Within a month , calls were up seventy per cent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Electricity plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not available for daily use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet one has to go back only some sixty years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in Reuben Colvin 's and Houghton 's gristmill on the West Branch in Factory Point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No records are available as to the date or extent of installation , but it may have been in 1896 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On June 14 , 1900 the Manchester Journal reported that an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for Edward S. Isham at `` Ormsby Hill '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In November 1900 surveying was done under John Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power plant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nothing came of it , perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The next step was construction by the Manchester Light and Power Company of a plant on the west bank of the Battenkill south of Union Street bridge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was nearly completed May 23 , 1901 with a promise of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go on until September 28 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was at the end of the sidewalk in front of the Dellwood Cemetery cottage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first directors of the Manchester Light and Power Company were John Marsden , M. L. Manley , William F. Orvis , George Smith , and John Blackmer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The officers were John Marsden , president ; John C. Blackmer , vice-president ; George Smith , treasurer ; and William F. Orvis , secretary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company , the Colonial Light and Power Company , for one year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under way , the Vail Light and Lumber Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery , intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Manchester then had two competing power companies until 1904 , when the Manchester Light and Power Company purchased the transmission system of the Vail Company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was fortunate , as the Vail plant burned in 1905 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Colonial Light and Power Company was succeeded by the Vermont Hydro-Electric Corporation , which in turn was absorbed by the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The latter now furnishes the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at Manchester Depot which was put into operation February 19 , 1930 and was improved in January 1942 by the installation of larger transformers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For a time following the abandonment of the local plant , electric current for Manchester was brought in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the Vermont Marble Company system to the north .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With respect to this view , two points are worth making .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More 's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More believed that a man could be both serious and gay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But to return to the main line of our inquiry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Utopia is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of modernity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study of the New Testament .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Had More 's writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone - because he wrote Utopia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only one other contemporary of More 's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work - Niccolo Machiavelli and The Prince .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The medieval was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More , the author of Utopia , in some intelligible relation with St. Thomas More , the martyr .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian Humanism , the Renaissance elements are of primary concern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is new about it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To that question the answer is simple ; it can be made in two words , Utopian communism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Surely there is nothing new about communism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We find it in Plato 's republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We find it in that `` common way of life pleasing to Christ and still in use among the truest societies of Christians '' , that is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We find it in the later Stoic conception of man 's natural condition which included the community of all possessions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle Ages ; and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as such that we are concerned with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus :
Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; we are concerned with Utopian communism - that is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Plato 's Republic communism is - to speak anachronistically - a communism of Janissaries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato 's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In More 's Utopia communism is not a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Utopian communism applies to all Utopians .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensable to that best ordering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors in spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato 's Republic :
in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The apostolic community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors , their spiritual athleticism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally , the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More 's time , although it was not accepted by all the theologian philosophers of the Middle Ages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The actual function of patristic civilian canonist scholastic communism was adequately set forth by St. Gregory almost a millennium before More wrote Utopia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The soil is common to all men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When we give the necessities of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We should think of it more as an act of justice than compassion '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund , wisely or unwisely , entrusted to his keeping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In contrast to this Stoic patristic view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original - a new thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not merely a new thing ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine 's encounter with man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Consider the features of Utopian communism :
generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private property , no money ; no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church Fathers of Late Antiquity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During the Brown trial , however , the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">While the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Editor Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Providence Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On October 31 , 1859 , John Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although Rhode Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John Brown 's trial with extreme interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On Wednesday morning , November 2 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The readers of the Providence Daily Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old Brown '' had a fair trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">J. Wheaton Smith , editor of the Warren Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in order that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The editor of the Newport Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital punishment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In direct contrast to the other Rhode Island editors , Samuel S. Foss of the Woonsocket Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown , Rhode Islanders turned their attention to the state elections .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The state had elected Republican candidates in the past two years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state offices by majorities , the failure was due to a lingering remnant of the Know-Nothing party , which called itself the American Republican party .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During the month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On November 7 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal reprinted a letter sent to John Brown from `` E. B. '' , a Quaker lady in Newport .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In reference to Brown 's raid she wrote , `` though we are non-resistants and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapons we know thee was anemated [ sic ] by the most generous and philanthropic motives '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` E. B. '' compared John Brown to Moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In contrast to `` E. B. '' , most Rhode Islanders hardly thought of John Brown as being another Moses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most attempts to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive audience in Rhode Island .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On Wednesday evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev. Mark Trafton of New Bedford , gave a `` Mission of Sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper 's Ferry insurrection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Warren Telegraph stated that many of Rev. Trafton 's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In its account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence Daily Post said that the remarks of Rev. Trafton made the people indignant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence Daily Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The Providence Daily Journal , however , stated that Brown 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Woonsocket Patriot admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A. Wise or James Buchanan '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Newport Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In her letter to John Brown , `` E. B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution , it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in `` E. B. 's '' suggestion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A week later the Daily Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The editor of the Daily Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for Providence '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Providence Daily Post 's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He further called upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On December 2 , 1859 , John Brown was hanged at Charles Town , Virginia .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Such was not the case in Rhode Island .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only public demonstration in honor of John Brown was held at Pratt 's Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt Hall meeting `` brought together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Seated on the platform were Amos C.

Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel w. Vaughan , and William H. H. Clements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The latter two were appointed secretaries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first speaker was Amos C. Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John Brown of Harper 's Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island 's colonial period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Barstow concluded that as Rhode Island 's John Brown became a canonized hero , if not a saint , so would it be with John Brown of Harper 's Ferry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The next speaker was George T. Day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although admitting Brown 's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; his deed was not below , but above the law '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Following Day was Woodbury who spoke of his disapproval of Brown 's attempt at servile insurrection , his admiration of Brown 's character , and his opposition to slavery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Woodbury 's remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The fourth and last speaker was Thomas Davis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By this time large numbers of the audience had left the hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He recalled that in Rhode Island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( Thomas W. Dorr ) proclaimed the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously :
Whereas , John Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper :
Therefore ,
Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Resolved that the anti slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Resolved , that we find in this fearful tragedy at Harper 's Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the morning following the Pratt Hall meeting the editor of the Providence Daily Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rather than being deceived , the eye is puzzled ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than - a picture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued - and set to shuttling again - only by conventional perspective ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked out in oil . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But here again , the surface declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives way in turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both - or neither .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because of the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The actual surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of , upon , the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In their very first collages , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real , bas-relief space - or to be about to do so - while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the upper center of Braque 's first collage , Fruit Dish ( in Douglas Cooper 's collection ) , a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the same time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in relation to the block capitals ; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane ; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the same thing , more or less , can be said of the contents of Picasso 's first collage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material - or simply of a painted in form - will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Flatness may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself - at least an optical if not , properly speaking , a pictorial illusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Depicted , Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind - and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness ; rather , it underpins and reinforces that literalness , re-creates it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Out of this re-created literalness , the Cubist subject reemerged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For it had turned out , by a further paradox of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cubism , in its 1911 - 1912 phase ( which the French , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge of abstract art .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If they opted for illusion , it could only be illusion per se - an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If , on the other hand , they opted for representation , it had to be representation per se - representation as image pure and simple , without connotations ( at least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for the first time , mutually exclusive alternatives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the end , Picasso and Braque plumped for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the inner , formal logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to the extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason - that is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic Cubism fully begin there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Synthetic Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was as though , in that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in general ) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut strings , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The affixed elements of collage were extruded , as it were , and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As it affects the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Subways improved land values without taking away land ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency engineers usually believe in them , and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This movement of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities - the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler 's Detroit plants , U. S. Steel 's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and power ( river ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet blighted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Until internal combustion became cheap , he had to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community of lower-class homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The railroad siding is still important - it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille route bus lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Willow Run , General Electric 's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse , the Pentagon , Boeing in Seattle , Douglas and Lockheed in Los Angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere - none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They are all suburban plants , relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And wherever the new thruways go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The drive along Massachusetts ' Route 128 , the by-pass which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston , may be a vision of the future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The future could be worse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The plants along Route 128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks and trees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They can even be rather grand , like Edward Land 's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But they deny the values of the city - the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting pot '' which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are segregated businesses , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work force from segregated communities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts ' Route 128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While the factories were always the center of the labor market , they were often on the city 's periphery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt 's motel has been relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public transit is feeble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some retailing , of course , always spreads with the population - grocery stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress shops , candy stores and the like .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set off for the downtown department store , where the selection would be greatest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Department stores congregated in the `` one hundred per cent location '' , where all the transit lines converged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more and more dry goods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put in the bank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Telephone orders distort the picture :
the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In many cases that statement `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store , though both are the same distance from home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Raymond Vernon reports that residents of East St. Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department store , the central location may be in serious trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Today , according to land economist Homer Hoyt , shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation 's Central Business Districts put together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children 's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket items .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Department stores were built on dry goods , especially ladies ' fashions , and in this area , in the long run , the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn out to be what management 's cost accountants refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather than major factors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Historically in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In their book American Skyline , Christopher Tunnard and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first superhighways - New York 's Henry Hudson and Chicago 's Lake Shore , San Francisco 's Bay Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the same time , Roosevelt 's Federal Housing Administration , coupled with Henry Morgenthau 's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U.

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Research at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg / l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb BOD / day / acre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen / hr / hp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They indicated that a 4 - day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent BOD reduction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Later , Eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the development of the Red Bridge Subdivision south of Kansas City , Missouri , the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sewage system from Kansas City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 yrs. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The oxidation pond has a surface area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 ft .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pond is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The large land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pilot plant was a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom , 4 ft below the surface , with a volume of 121000 gal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The major contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from 314 persons with a 4 - day aeration period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Initially , the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18 - month period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increasing load , over a reasonable period of time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pilot plant was equipped with a 3 - hp turbine aerator ( Figure 2 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The aerator had a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24 - hr charts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue River through a surface drainage ditch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Composite samples were collected at weekly intervals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The composite samples were normally collected over a 6 - hr period , but an occasional 24 - hr composite was made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the 6 - hr composite samples with 24 - hr operations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The data indicated that the organic load during the 6 - hr composites was essentially 50 per cent of the 24 - hr organic load .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Efforts were made to take the grab samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6 - hr composite sample .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A single 24 - hr composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 mg / l with an average of 350 mg / l .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was equivalent to 240 mg / l BOD on a 24 - hr basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The BOD in the effluent averaged 58 mg / l , a 76 - per cent reduction over the 24 - hr period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Examination of the data in Table 1 , shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent BOD .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The periods of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ice caused the aerator to overload , straining the drive belts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of BOD / day or about 2 lb BOD / day 1000 cu ft aeration capacity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Needless to say , the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis , but was 270 lb BOD / day / acre on a surface loading basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open sewers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As construction progresses , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6 days , averaging 6.4 days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The large amount of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The vegetables were not readily metabolized by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The average volatile suspended solids in the effluent was 75 mg / l while MLSS averaged 170 mg / l volatile suspended solids .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The average sludge age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be 14.5 days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged 0.8 mg / l / hr during the first four months of this study .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2 to 2.6 mg / l / hr which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active microbial solids with the heavier , less active solids settling out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The suspended solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the BOD .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Removal of the suspended solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 mg / l BOD .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The BOD in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 mg / l .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This low BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Routine microscopic examinations were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by McKinney and Gram for the various types of protozoa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation pond .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bacteria formed typical activated sludge floc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The floc particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Initially , the flagellated protozoa predominated , but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated protozoa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As the temperature decreased , the number of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Very little protozoa activity existed below 40 ` F .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the temperature reached 32 ` F all protozoan activity ceased ; but as the temperature rose , the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only once were stalked ciliates found in the mixed liquor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of a high bacterial population .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The data given in Table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 - mg / l dissolved oxygen concentration and 10 ` C for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg / l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lb / day at a maximum rate of 9.3 mg / l / hr .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium nitrate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The location of the oxidation pond in a high value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 mg / l of BOD with an average of 230 mg / l .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The BOD data are given in Table 4 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A single 24 - hr composite sample had a BOD of 260 mg / l , indicating a typical domestic sewage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 147000 gpd , giving a retention period of 42 days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The organic loading on the pond was slightly under 60 lb BOD / day / acre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The effluent BOD averaged 34 mg / l , a little lower than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading of 60 lb BOD / day / acre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The BOD of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47 mg / l .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Microscopic examination of the effluent showed that minimum BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the algae began to build up again , the effluent BOD rose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During the two weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent BOD 's in the effluent were 18 and 16 mg / l .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scotty did not go back to school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University Hospital - Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family - and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty much as he chose - provided , of course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that , if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was discharged from the hospital after a two day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley described as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rachel wore a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Scotty 's father sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Teachers - men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles - came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rachel was polite , Scotty indifferent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces and Scotty gazed without interest at his food , the teachers , the heroic baronial windows , and the bright ranks of college banners .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His father tried to make the food a topic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The blueberry pie is good , Scotty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I recommend it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked at his son , his face worried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scotty murmured , `` No , thanks '' , so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He said more loudly , `` I'm full , old Pop '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had eaten almost nothing on the crested , three sectioned plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper container .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He's all right , Craig '' , Rachel said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since his seizure , Scotty had had little appetite ; yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , was one of plumpness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His face was fuller ; his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen looking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He breathed now with his mouth open , showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth ; he kept his eyes , with their puffed blurred lids , always lowered , though not , apparently , focusing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even his neck seemed thicker and therefore shorter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His hands , which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They lay on his lap , palms up , stiffly motionless , the tapered fingers a little thick at the joints .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Altogether he had , since the seizure , the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He looked lazy , spoiled , a little querulous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rachel had little to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She greeted her husband 's colleagues with smiling politeness , offering nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. McKinley , for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity , was completely alert to his son , eyes always on the still face , jumping to anticipate Scotty 's desires .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a strained , silent lunch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rachel said , `` I 'd better get him to bed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since Mr. McKinley had to give a lecture , Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They did not speak much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and said softly , `` Look at those stupid kids '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a Negro section of peeling row houses , store-front churches and ragged children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He said , `` Nothing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And then : `` There are lots of kids around here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scotty looked at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He felt tired and full and calm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The days seemed short , perhaps because his routine was , each day , almost the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Virginia treated him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuits , cookies , candies - the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would hover over him and , looking like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty 's fork or spoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You do n't eat enough , honey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Try to get that down '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rachel , observing , would say , `` He has to rediscover his own capacity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It 'll take time '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both watched Scotty constantly , Rachel without seeming to , Virginia openly , her eyes filled with concern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scotty was neutral .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did not resent their supervision or Virginia 's sometimes tiring sympathy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He ate what he felt like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His energy was gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly - they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite - folded in his lap ; his mouth hung slightly open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had not mentioned Kate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly , almost accidentally , encounter her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest , but it was an objective pain , in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind ; it was like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed ; it was merely another part of his weakness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was calm , drugged , and lazy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rachel mentioned Kate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She said , `` I notice the girl from across the street has n't bothered to phone or visit '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scotty said , `` That 's all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kate 's all right '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought about it briefly , then deliberately turned the talk to something else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once , sitting at the front window in his parents ' room , he saw Kate come out of her house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was with Elizabeth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were far off and looked tiny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They turned at the bottom of Kate 's steps and moved off in the direction of the park .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He thought he saw - it awakened and , for a moment , interested him - that Elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The doctor , since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him , came often and informally to the house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would sit , slim-waisted and spare , on the edge of Scotty 's bed , his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scotty did not mind the doctor 's unsmiling teasing as he used to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Husky young man '' , he said with mock distaste .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I imagine you 're always battling in school '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't go to school any more '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Pardon '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The doctor had to bend close to hear ; his delicate hand , as veined as a moth 's wing , rested absently on Scotty 's chest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scotty said the same words more loudly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well , we 're taking a little vacation , that 's all '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He turned unsmilingly to Rachel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could now but the weakness is very definite ; it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He 'll be stronger soon '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His stethoscope was on the table by Scotty 's bed and he picked it up and wagged it at Scotty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He said fussily , `` Just keep the cap on those strong emotions '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll drop by again in a few days '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She smoothed the covers on Scotty 's bed and picked things up from the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She did not touch him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scotty watched with disinterest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not speak .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had no desire to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She said , `` Do you think you 'll miss school '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He felt her irritability did not concern him , yet he knew he would not care even if it did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We 've had any number of calls about you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You could win a popularity contest at that school without any trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Miss Estherson called twice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She wants to pay you a visit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She says the children miss you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Apparently you were the light of their lives '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scotty shrugged slightly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Rachel came close to the bed , bent as if she would kiss him , then moved away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was frowning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That doctor annoys me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She seemed to speak to herself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do you suppose his self-consciousness is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or merely of doctors in general '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She turned to him again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , Mrs. Charles - Sally - has phoned too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was very worried '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rachel 's tone was dry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She did n't really say '' - She glanced away at the floor , then swooped gracefully and picked up one of Scotty 's slippers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I mean , do you feel like seeing Kate '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scotty said , `` I do n't know '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was the slight pain , but it was no different from the throbbing in his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , there 's time , in any case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We 'll wait till you 're stronger and then talk about it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scotty said , `` Okay '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scotty was pleased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His father was a constant visitor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Scotty would hear the front door in the evening and then his father 's deep slow voice ; it floated up the stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` How 's Scotty '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And Rachel 's or Virginia 's reply : `` Better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's getting plenty of rest '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Is his appetite improved '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or : `` Does he get exercise '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The exchange was almost invariable , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He never smiled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After a pause , during which he studied Scotty 's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr. McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm eating more '' , he would say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or : `` I walk around the house a lot '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Perhaps you should get out a little '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm not supposed to yet '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was not irritated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did not mind the useless , kindly questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He looked at the lined face with vague interest ; he felt he was noting it , as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care , seeking something material to blame for his son 's illness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Have you got enough blankets '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And another time , without accusation : `` You never wore that scarf I bought you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves upward in angry motion , Papa-san sat glacier like , his smooth solidity , his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Our objective '' , the colonel had said that day of the briefing , `` is Papa-san '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There the objective sat , brooding over all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Gouge , burn , blast , insult it as they would , could anyone really take Papa-san ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Between the ponderous hulk and himself , in the valley over which Papa-san reigned , men had hidden high explosives , booby traps , and mines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the slope 's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye range like a wild tangle of children 's hoops , stopped simultaneously , weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child 's touch to start them all rolling again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Closer still , regular barricades of barbed wire hung on timber supports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Was it all vain labor ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Who would clean up the mess when the war was over ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Smiling at his quixotic thoughts , Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tonight a group of men , tomorrow night he himself , would go out there somewhere and wait .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he were to go with White , he would be out there two days , not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san , but moving ever deeper into enemy land - behind Papa-san itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Was this what he had expected ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had n't realized that there would be so much time to think , so many lulls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told , that combat was an intermittent activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now he knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on the train would have to be approached .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It could take place tomorrow night , or it might occur months from now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was just too much time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Time to become afraid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">White 's suggestion flattered , but he did not like the identity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not spill over with hatred for the enemy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had n't even seen him yet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pressing his cigarette out in the earth , Warren walked to the slit and scanned the jagged hills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw no life , but still stood there for a time peering at the unlovely hills , his gaze continually returning to Papa-san .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had come here in order to test himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While most of his beliefs were still unsettled , he knew that he did not believe in killing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet , he was here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a coward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were ten men on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot led out that next night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The beaming rok was carrying a thirty caliber machine gun ; another man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Warren and White each carried , in addition to their own weapons and ammo , a box of ammo for the ROK 's machine gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Others carried extra clips for the Browning Automatic Rifle , which was in the hands of a little Mexican named Martinez .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We just sit quiet and wait '' , Prevot had said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Be sure the man nearest you is awake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If Joe does n't show up , we 'll all be back here at 0600 hours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Otherwise , we hold a reception .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then we pull out under our mortar and artillery cover , but nobody pulls out until I say so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Remember what I said about going out to get anybody left behind ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That still holds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We bring back all dead and wounded '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the point of departure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then began the journey through their own mine fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ours were kinder than theirs , some said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They set bouncing betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully had them go off at the head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Big ones and little .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The crude wooden boxes of the enemy , our nicely turned gray metal disks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But theirs defied the detectors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A foot misplaced , a leg missing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All sizes : big ones , some wired to set off a whole field , little ones , hand grenade size .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Booby traps to fill the head with chunks of metal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by looking at the sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was dark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prevot had said that the searchlights would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours , `` which gives us time to get settled in position '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because they were new men and to be sure that they did n't get lost , Prevot had placed Warren and White in the center of the patrol as it filed out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His eyes now fixed on White 's solid figure , Warren could hear behind him the tread of another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were going to follow it for part of their journey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's safe '' , Prevot had said , `` and it provides cover for our noise '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On their right rose the embankment covered with brush and trees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If a branch extended out too far , each man held it back for the next , and if they met a low overhang , each warned the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , stealthily they advanced upstream ; then they turned to the right , climbed the embankment , and walked into the valley again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no cover here , only grass sighing against pant-legs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And with each sigh , like a whip in the hand of an expert , the grass stripped something from Warren .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The gentle whir of each footstep left him more naked than before , until he felt his unprotected flesh tremble , chilled by each new sound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The shapes of the men ahead of him lacked solidity , as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage , their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The warped , broken trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Clumps of brush that they passed were so many enchained demons straining in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Looming over all , Papa-san leered down at him , threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Off in the distance a searchlight flashed on , its beam slashing the sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud , then reflected to the earth in a softer , diffused radiance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Somewhere over there another patrol had need of light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Warren thought of all the men out that night who , like himself , had left their protective ridge and - fear working at their guts - picked their way into the area beyond .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the east to the west coast of the Korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear filled men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night , sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound , or shouting amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">White 's arm went up and Warren raised his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The patrol was stopping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Prevot came up `` Take that spot over there '' , he whispered , pointing to a small clump of blackness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Give me your machine gun ammo '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lying in the grass behind the brush clump , Warren looked about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes , setting up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Warren eased his rifle 's safety off and gently , slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with an X .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This he placed within quick reach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The walk and his fears had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the night air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the armored vest fitted the upper part of his body snugly , he felt no security .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark ; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certain this menace was only imaginary , he yet stared in fascinated horror , his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was aware of insistent inner beatings , as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Above , the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds , diluting the valley 's dark to a pallid light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees , standing like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sensing the unseen presence of the other men in the patrol , he felt mutely united to these nine near strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He sensed something precious in the perilous moment , something akin to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the French countryside , a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger to their exultation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning - enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Brittany , that stone-gray mystery through which he traveled for thirty days , sleeping in the barns of farmers or alongside roads , had worked some subtle change in him , he knew , and it was in Brittany that he had met Pierre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pierre had no hands ; they had been severed at the wrists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With leather cups fitted in his handlebars , he steered his bicycle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He and Warren had traveled together for four days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They visited the shipyards at Brest and Pierre had to sign the register , vouching for the integrity of the visiting foreigner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He took the pen in his stumps and began to write .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Wait !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wait '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">cried the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They crowded the small room and peered over one another 's shoulders to watch the handless man write his name in the book .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` C'est formidable '' , they exclaimed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mais , oui .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">C'est merveilleux '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And then the questions came , eager , interested questions , and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Does n't it ever bother you '' , Warren had asked , `` to have people always asking you about your hands '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , the French are a very curious people '' , Pierre had laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They are also honest seekers after truth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now the English are painfully silent about my missing hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Americans , like yourself , take the fact for granted , try to be helpful , but do n't ask questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I'm used to all three , but I think the French have the healthiest attitude '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That was the day that Pierre had told Warren about the Abbey of Solesmes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You are looking tired and there you can rest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It will be good for you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think , too '' , he said , his dark eyes mischievous , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you have spoken '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Within two weeks Warren was ringing the bell at the abbey gate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The monk who opened the door immediately calmed his worries about his reception : `` I speak English '' , the old man said , `` but I do not hear it very well '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that might help .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Smiling at Warren 's protestations , the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Will you please wait in here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Al 's Little Cafe was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingled scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and Italian cooking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hanging over the bar was an oil painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him , or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the low-down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The reporters had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His friend Jane was with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too much and did n't own the mint .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This meant sorting out press clippings and the like .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jane sat receptive and interested .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said , `` You see , both of them , I mean the President and Jeff Lawrence , are romantics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and all he has to do is find the right key , and then divine justice and altruism will appear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It 's like focusing a camera ; the distant ship is n't there until you get the focus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You know what I'm talking about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live with them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But when it comes to war , the Colonel knows what it is and Jeff does n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Christiansen knows that a soldier will get the Distinguished Service Medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had a mean , unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit , and someone invented the name Trig for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's to say , he was trigger happy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 'd shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was a wiry , inscrutable , silent country boy from the red clay of rural Alabama , and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally make fun of .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But not in front of Trig .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I heard of some that tried it back in the States , and he 'd knock them clear across the room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There 'd been a pretty bad incident back at the Marine base .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A New York kid , a refugee from one of the Harlem gangs , made fun of Trig 's accent , and drew a knife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Before the fight was over , the Harlem boy had a concussion and Trig was cut up badly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They caught Trig stealing liquor from the officers ' mess , and he got a couple of girls in trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fear of punishment just did n't bother him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was n't there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was left out of him at birth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is why he made such a magnificent soldier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He was n't troubled with the ordinary , rank-and-file fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers and whole companies under fire running in panic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It just did n't occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jane nodded with a pleasant smile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` All right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a sniper 's nest in a mountain cave , and it was picking off our men with devilish accuracy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out , and I suggested , ' You ask for volunteers , and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky , ten dollars and a week-end pass to Davao ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Trig was one of the five volunteers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The patrol snaked around in back of the cave , approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You could hear them from our outpost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a lot of shooting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We knew the enemy was subdued , because a flare was fired as the signal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So we hurried over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two of our men were killed , a third was wounded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Trig and a very black colored boy from Detroit had killed or put out of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When we got there , Trig and the Negro were quarreling over possession of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded Filipino .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The colored boy had it , and Trig lunged at him with a knife and said , ' Give that to me , you black bastard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We do n't ' low nigras to walk on the same sidewalk with white men where I come from ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` The Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` What did the Colonel do about the men '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jane asked in her placid , interested way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mickie laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` He recommended both of them for the DSM and the Detroit fellow for the Purple Heart , too , for a combat inflicted wound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So you see Mr. Christiansen knows what it 's all about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But not Jeff Lawrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he was in the war , he was in Law or Supplies or something like that , and an old buddy of his told me he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon and read the citations for medals - just like the one we sent in for Trig - and go away with a real glow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These were heroes nine feet tall to him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jefferson Lawrence was alone at the small , perfectly appointed table by the window looking out over the river .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a serpent with two heads .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Open beside him was Mrs. Dalloway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He thought how this dainty , fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of Westminster on a day in June , enjoying the flowers in the shops , the greetings from old friends , but never really drawing a deep , passionate breath , was so like himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He , and Mrs. Dalloway , too , had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the bone marrow of the spirit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had not because he was both poor and ambitious .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He made the decision with his eyes open , or so he thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At any cost , he must leave the dreary Pennsylvania mining town where his father was a pharmacist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And so he had , so he had .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At State College , he had no time to walk among the violets on the water 's edge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From his room he could look out in springtime and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly , deliciously , across the campus , and he could smell the sweet vernal winds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was not stone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was not unmoved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had to teach himself patiently that these traps were not for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He must mentally pull the blinds and close the window , so that all that existed was in the books before him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At law school , the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More of this stamping down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By the time he was prosperous enough - his goals were high - he was bald and afraid of women .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The only one who would have him was his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who became his wife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps it was right ; perhaps it was just .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had dared to defy nature , to turn his back to the Lorelei , and he was punished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Like Mrs. Dalloway , with her regrets about Peter Walsh , he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If he had had a son , he would tell him , `` Gather ye rosebuds while ye may .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But then his son could afford it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lawrence was waiting for Bill Boxell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Vice President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He said the matter was urgent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary was uneasy about the visit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did not like Boxell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He suspected something underhanded and furtive about him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lawrence could not put his finger on it precisely , and this worried him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When you disliked or distrusted a man , you should have a reason .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Human nature was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic , hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice President would appear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It did not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point of view .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A half hour later the Vice President arrived .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He looked very carefully at every piece of furnishing , as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He observed the Florentine vase in the hall , the Renoir painting in the library , as well as the long shelves of well-bound volumes ; the pattern of the Oriental rug , the delicate cut-glass chandelier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said to the Secretary , `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How did you find out about this '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He waved his arm around at the furnishings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was not a discourteous question , Lawrence decided .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious ; he had to find out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary did not tell him at what cost , at what loneliness , he learned these things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He merely said , `` Any good decorator these days can make you a tasteful home '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Vice President said , `` If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they decorated the Vice President 's home , let me know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I can do business with that kind '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Again , Lawrence thought a little sadly , these were the fees of poverty and ambition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had brandy in the library .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Boxell looked at Lawrence with a searching glance , the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What are your weaknesses ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where will you break ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How best to destroy your peace ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Vice President said with a slight bluster , `` There is n't anyone who loves the President more than I do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Old Chris is my ideal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the same time , you have to face facts and realize that a man who 's been in the Marine Corps all his life does n't understand much about politics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What does a monk know about sex '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lawrence listened with the practiced , deceptive calm of the lawyer , but his face was in the shadow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` So , we have to protect the old man for his own good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You see what I mean .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Congress is full of politicians , and if you want to get along with them , you have to be politic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is why I say we just can't go ahead and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let me tell you what happened to me today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A fellow came up to me , a Senator , I do n't have to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the President like a brother , but God damn it , he 's crucifying me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 've got a quarter of a million Germans in my state , and those krautheads tune in on Father Werther every night , and if he tells them to go out and piss in the public square , that 's what they do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament of Germany ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And another one comes to me and he says , ' Look here , there 's a mill in my state employs five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Bishop looked at him coldly and said `` Take it or leave it '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Literally , there was nothing else to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was caught in a machine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let 's go and see what it 's like '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa River , a small and dirty stream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived - servants and laborers huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beyond were industries and factories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then they went down to Black Bottom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the midst of this crowded region was the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it was a landmark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town , black and white , knew of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It had just suffered a calamity , the final crisis in a long series of calamities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead , and the city mourned him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He was stern and overbearing with his flock , but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites , especially the rich who partly supported the church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Deacon Board , headed by a black man named Carlson , had practically taken over as the pastor grew old , and had its way with the support of the Amen corner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious orgy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It began invariably in low tones , almost conversational , and then gradually worked up to high , shrill appeals to God and man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And then the Amen corner took hold , re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West Indies , and then here in Alabama .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With shout and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and contortion , the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering , wailing , shouting , possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they lived from week to week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wilson , on his first Sunday , witnessed this with something like disgust .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He had preached a short sermon , trying to talk man-to-man to the audience , to tell them who he was , what he had done in Macon and Birmingham , and what he proposed to do here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But then , at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had no chance to say another word .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the very end , when the audience was silent and breathless , a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The audience did not think much of the new pastor , and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the next weeks he looked over the situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all there was the parsonage , an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live in , originally poorly conceived , apparently not repaired for years , with no plumbing or sewage , with rat-holes and rot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church , a woman named Catt who , as Wilson afterward found , was briefly referred to as The Cat because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ann Catt was a lonely , devoted soul , never married , conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church , but a perpetual dissenter and born critic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The salary of the pastor had for years been $ 500 annually and even this was in arrears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $ 2500 , but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The church itself must be repaired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was dirty and neglected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It really ought to be rebuilt , and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile , the city itself should be talked to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The streets in the colored section were dirty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was typhoid and malaria .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The children had nowhere to go and no place to play , not even sidewalks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The school was small , dark and ill-equipped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The teacher was a pliant fool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were two liquor saloons not very far from the church , one white , that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for Negroes ; the other exclusively Negro .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Undoubtedly , there was a good deal of gambling in both .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other side of the church was a quiet , well-kept house with shutters and recently painted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wilson inquired about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was called Kent House .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The deacon of the church , Carlson , was its janitor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the leading members of the Amen corner was cook ; there were two or three colored maids employed there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people , which seemed to him rather queer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Why should a white hotel be set down in the center of Black Bottom ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But nevertheless it looked respectable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was glad to have it there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The rest of Black Bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect , disrepair and careful upkeep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Dives , carefully repaired huts , and nicely painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl with little distinction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The best could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The yards , front and back , were narrow ; some were trash dumps , some had flower gardens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Behind were privies , for there was no sewage system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After looking about a bit , Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom , across the river and far removed from the white city , a considerable tract of land , and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He talked about it to the Presiding Elder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Presiding Elder looked him over rather carefully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But there was one thing that he had to stress , and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses , the dollar money , had been seriously falling behind in this church , and that must be looked after immediately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact , he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here - to make a larger contribution of dollar money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was , they must have a better church , a more business-like conduct of the church organization , and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He emphasized to the Presiding Elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Presiding Elder was sure that that would be impossible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he told Wilson to `` go ahead and try '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And Wilson tried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It did seem impossible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears , and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in , and that none would be sold to colored folk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When it was proposed to rebuild the church , Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was sure that he could do better if he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But when this proposal was made to his Deacon Board , he met unanimous opposition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The church certainly would not be removed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The very proposition was sacrilege .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It had been here fifty years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was going to stay forever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As for rebuilding , well , that might be looked into , but there was no hurry , no hurry at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Wilson again went downtown to a different banker , an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic , but he shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Reverend '' , he said , `` I think you do n't quite understand the situation here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do n't you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tenements , stores , saloons , some gambling , I hope not too much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The colored people are getting employment at Kent House and other places , and they are near their places of employment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By that time , perhaps something better can be done '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then Wilson asked , `` What about this Kent House which you mention ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do n't understand why a white hotel should be down here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The young banker looked at him with a certain surprise , and then he said flatly : `` I'm afraid I can't tell you anything in particular about Kent House .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You 'll have to find out about it on your own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hope to see you again '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he dismissed the colored pastor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was next day that Sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She said , `` My dear , do you know what Kent House is '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' , said Wilson , `` I do n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was just asking about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What is it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's a house of prostitution for white men with white girls as inmates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They hire a good deal of local labor , including two members of our Trustee Board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized by some of the best white gentlemen in town '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wilson stared at her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` My dear , you must be mistaken '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Talk to Mrs. Catt '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And after Wilson had talked to Mrs. Catt and to others , he was absolutely amazed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This , of course , was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities - putting white houses of prostitution colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the part of the Negroes as they became more educated and got better wages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But this situation of Kent House was more subtle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The wages involved were larger and more regular .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The inmates were white and from out of town , avoiding local friction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The backing from the white town was greater and there was little publicity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Good wages , patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the Methodist church , if not in all churches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a fog , which increased the darkness of the night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He might have been anywhere or nowhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr. Verdi .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Secretary of State Seward was a sick man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The idea had come from Herold , who had once been a chemist 's clerk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The sick were always receiving medicines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one would question such an errand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bottle was filled up with flour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse , Seward 's home , where Key had once been killed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now it would have another death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He clomped heavily up the stoop and rang the bell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like the bell at Mass , the doorbell was pitched too high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was still Good Friday , after all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A nigger boy opened the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Payne did not notice him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was thinking chiefly of Cap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If their schedules were to synchronize , there was no point in wasting time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He pushed his way inside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For a moment the hall confused him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was the largest house he had ever been in , almost the largest building , except for a hotel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had no idea where Seward 's room would be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the half darkness the banisters gleamed , and the hall seemed enormous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Above him somewhere were the bedrooms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Seward would be up there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He explained his errand , but without bothering much to make it plausible , for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did not really want to kill , but as in the sexual act , there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed , even while you watched yourself giving way to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was no longer worried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everything would be all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , the sensation always surprised him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a thrill he felt no part in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick , appalling , and efficient things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were carpeted , but made for pumps and congress gaiters , not the great clodhoppers he wore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled drum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stopped and whispered his errand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Young Frederick Seward held out his hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Panting a little , Payne shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dr. Verdi had told him to deliver his package in person .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping , and then went through a pantomime at his father 's door , to prove the statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Very well '' , Payne said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I will go '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He smiled , but now that he knew where the elder Seward was , he did not intend to go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He pulled out his pistol and fired it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It made no sound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It had misfired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Reversing it , he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward 's head , over and over again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the first blow that was always difficult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After that , violence was exultantly easy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He got caught up into it and became a different person .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle over it for days , whereas at the time it had seemed quite real .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The nigger boy fled down the stairs , screaming , `` Murder '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was not murder at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Payne was more methodical than that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was merely clearing a way to what he had to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He ran for the sick room , found his pistol was broken , and threw it away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A knife would do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From childhood he had known all about knives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Someone blocked the door from inside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He saw only dimly moving figures , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He went for the bed , jumped on it , and struck where he could , repeatedly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was like finally getting into one 's own nightmares to punish one 's dreams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two men pulled him off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nobody said anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Payne hacked at their arms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a lady there , in a nightdress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would not have wanted to hurt a lady .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another man approached , this one fully dressed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the knife went into his chest , he went down at once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm mad '' , shouted Payne , as he ran out into the hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm mad '' , and only wished he had been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That would have made things so much easier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he was not mad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was only dreaming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He clattered down the stairs and out of the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Somewhere in the fog , the nigger boy was still yelling murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One always wakes up , even from one 's own dreams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The clammy air revived him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Herold , he saw , had fled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well , one did not expect much of people like Herold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He unhitched his horse , walked it away , mounted , and spurred it on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The nigger boy was close behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He rode on and on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had no idea where he was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After some time he came to an open field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An open field was better than a building , that was for sure , so he dismounted , turned off the horse , and plunged through the grass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He felt curiously sleepy , the world seemed far away ; he knew he should get to Cap , but he did n't know how .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was sure , for he had done as he was told , had n't he ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cap would find him and take care of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So choosing a good tree , he clambered up into it , found a comfortable notch , and curled up in it to sleep , like the tousled bear he was , with his hands across his chest , as though surfeited with honey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Violence always made him tired , but he was not frightened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In Boston , Edwin Booth was winding up a performance of A New Way to Pay Old Debts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Acting soothed him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">As Sir Giles Overreach ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he raised his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was one of the high spots of the play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The audience , as usual , loved it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was delighted to see them so happy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he had any worries , it was only the small ones , about Mother in New York , and his daughter Edwina and what she might be doing at this hour , with her Aunt Asia , in Philadelphia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Everyone is ambivalent about his profession , if he has practised it long enough , but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there , who might cheer you or boo you , but that was largely , though not entirely , up to you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They made the world seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wilkes was quite right about one thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Laura Keene had been in the green room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The commotion had brought her into the wings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since she could not act , one part suited her as well as any other , and so she was the first person to offer Mr. Lincoln a glass of water , holding it up to the box , high above her head , to Miss Harris , who had asked for it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She had been one of the first to collect her wits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience , as that they had been stunned already .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of them had seen Our American Cousin before , and unless Miss Keene was on stage , there was not much to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The stage had been empty , except for Harry Hawk , doing his star monologue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The audience was fond of Harry Hawk , he was a dear , in or out of character , but he was not particularly funny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the end of the monologue the audience would applaud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile it looked at the scenery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , I guess I know enough to turn you inside out , you sockdologizing old mantrap '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">said Trenchard , otherwise Hawk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was always a pause here , before the next line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That was when the gun went off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet even that explosion did not mean much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Guns were going off all over Washington City these days , because of the celebrations , and the theatre was not soundproof .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then the audience saw a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sic semper tyrannis '' , it said mildly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Booth had delivered his line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They strained forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They had not heard what had been said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The figure leapt from the box , almost lost its balance , the flag draped there tore in the air , the figure landed on its left leg , fell on its hands , and pressed itself up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Harry Hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His speech faltered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not lower his arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The figure was so theatrically dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The Octoroon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This figure looked like the slave dealer from that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it also looked like a toad , hopping away from the light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then it disappeared into the wings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Harry Hawk had not shifted position , but he at last lowered his arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Lincoln screamed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no mistaking that scream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet this scream had a different note in it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clara Harris , one of the guests in the box , stood up and demanded water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her action was involuntary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When something unexpected happened , one always asked for water if one were a woman , brandy if one were a man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Lincoln screamed again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the Presidential box someone leaned over the balustrade and yelled : `` He has shot the President '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That got everybody up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the stage , Harry Hawk began to weep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Laura Keene brushed by him with the glass of water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The crowd began to move .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In Washington City everyone lived in a bubble of plots , and one death might attract another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was not exactly panic they gave way to , but they could not just sit there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The beehive voices , for no one could bear silence , drowned out the sound of Mrs. Lincoln 's weeping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would not give .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A Dr. Charles Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Someone opened the corridor door from the inside , and called for a doctor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Somehow Dr. Charles Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went straight to the Presidential box .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As usual , Mrs. Lincoln had lost her head , but nobody blamed her for doing so now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was a little blood on the hem of her dress , for the assassin had slashed Miss Harris 's companion , Major Rathbone , with a knife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rathbone said he was bleeding to death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the look of him he was n't that far gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With a sneer , the man spread his legs and , a third time , confronted them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once more , Katie reared , and whinnied in fear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For a moment , boy and mount hung in midair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stevie twisted and , frantically , commanded the mare to leap straight ahead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the stranger was nimbler still .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With a bold arm , he dared once more to obstruct them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Katie reared a third time , then , trembling , descended .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The stranger leered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Seizing the bridle , he tugged with all his might and forced Katie to her knees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was absurd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stevie could feel himself toppling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw the ground coming up - and the stranger 's head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With incredible ferocity , he brought his fists together and struck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The blow encountered silky hair and hard bone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man uttered a weird cry , spun about , and collapsed in the sand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Katie scrambled to her feet , Stevie agilely retaining his seat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Again Katie reared , and now , wickedly , he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could feel his own feet , iron-shod , striking repeatedly until the body was limp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He gloated , and his lips slavered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He heard himself chortling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They rode around and around to trample the figure into the sand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only the top of the head , with a spot bare and white as a clamshell , remained visible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stevie was shouting triumphantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A train hooted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instantly , he chilled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were pursuing him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was frightened ; his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Then Katie stumbled , and again he was falling , falling !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Stevie !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stevie '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His mother was nudging him , but he was still falling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His head hung over the boards of Katie 's stall ; before it was sprawled the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Stevie , wake up now !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We're nearly there '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had been dreaming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was safe in his Mama 's arms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The train had slowed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Houses winked as the cars rolled beside a little depot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Po ' Chavis '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the trainman called .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He came by and repeated , `` Po ' Chavis '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bong !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bong !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">startled him awake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bong !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">a dull boom and a throbbing echo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The walls bulged , the floor trembled , the windowpanes rattled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stared at the far morning , expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bong !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He raced to the window and yanked at the sash .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bong !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the wood was old , the paint alligatored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bong !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A fresh breeze saluted him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Six o'clock !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He put his his head out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was the slate roof of the church ; ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green scaled monster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The clock which had struck presented an innocent face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There 's a tower and a steeple on the church a million feet high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And the loudest clock in the whole world '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I know , Stephen '' , she smiled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They say that our steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The clock you heard strike - it 's really the town clock - was installed last April by Mrs. Shorter , on her birthday '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He dressed , and sped outdoors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The steeple leaned backward , while the church advanced like a headless creature in a long , shapeless coat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The spire seemed to hold up the sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Port Jervis , basking in the foothills , was the city of God .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Dutch Reformed Church , with two steeples and its own school was on Main Street ; the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street ; the Catholic Saint Mary's Church , with an even taller steeple and a cross on top , stood on Ball Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Catholics had the largest cemetery , near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south ; Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">God was everywhere , in the belfry , in the steeple , in the clouds , in the trees , and in the mountains hulking on the horizon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Somewhere , beyond , where shadows lurked , must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached and the dreadful Lake of Fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So , walking in awe , he became familiar with God , who resided chiefly in Drew Centennial Church with its high steeple and clock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no church like Drew Church , no preacher like Papa , who was intimate with Him , and could consign sinners to hellfire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To know God he must follow in Papa 's footsteps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was fortunate , and proud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The veterans , idling on their benches in the Square , beneath the soldiers ' monument , got to their feet when Papa approached : `` Morning , Reverend '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His being and His will - Stevie could not divide God from his Papa - illumined every parish face , turned the choir into a band of angels , and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We have nine hundred and eleven members in our charge '' , Mama announced , `` and three hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Papa went out to do God 's work , Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy , which was drawn by Violet , the new black mare .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown , beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine shop , and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal , and northward to Brooklyn , below Point Peter , he could see the church spire wherever he looked back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse - `` Afternoon , Reverend '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- and crossed the suspension bridge to Matamoras ; that was Pennsylvania .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the Delaware River , three long islands were overgrown with greening trees and underbrush .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">South of Laurel Grove Cemetery , and below the junction of the Neversink and the Delaware , was the Tri-State Rock , from which Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania , as well as New York , simply by spinning around on his heel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On these excursions , Papa instructed him on man 's chief end , which was his duty to God and his own salvation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , a boy 's lively eyes might rove .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where Cuddleback Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent swimming hole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing youth : `` Idle recreation '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Stevie saw no idols ; it troubled him that he could n't always see what Papa saw .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was torn between the excitement in the sun inflamed waters and a little engine chugging northward on the Monticello Branch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where you been today '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ludie inquired every evening , pretending that he did not care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He'll make a preacher out of you '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , he won't '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stevie flared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not me '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Somebody 's got to be a preacher in the family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He made a will and last testament before we left Paterson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I heard them !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Uncle and Aunt Howe were the witnesses '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Will he die '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Everybody does '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ludie could be hateful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To speak of Papa dying was a sin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It could never happen as long as God was alert and the Drew steeple stood guard with its peaked lance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stevie was constantly slipping into the church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He pulled with all his strength at the heavy , brass bound door , and shuffled along the wainscoted wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cold , mysterious presence of God was all around him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the end of a shaft of light , the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Far away , standing before a curtained window in the study room , was his father , hands tucked under his coattails , and staring into the dark church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles and gray hair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Would Papa really die ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mouth was thin lipped and wide , the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Papa 's slender fingers removed the spectacles , there were red indentations on the bridge of the strong nose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's time you began to think on God , Stephen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps one day He will choose you as He chose me , long ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Therefore , give Him your affection and store up His love for you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Open your heart to Him and pray , Stephen , pray !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the Lake of Fire '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stevie had heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For he feared the Lake of Fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He strove to think of God and His eternal wrath ; he must pray to be spared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Papa was disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the Call .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not George , Townley , or Ted , certainly not Ludie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Burt was at Hackettstown and Will at Albany Law School , where they surely could not hear it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Someday God would choose him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would hear the Call and would run to tell Papa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The stern face would relax , the black clad arms would embrace him , `` My son '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet how might he know the Call when it came ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Probably , as in Scriptures , a still , small voice would whisper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would summon him once ; if he missed it , never again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What if it came when he was playing , or was asleep and dreaming ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He must not fail to hear it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was Papa 's chosen ; therefore , nothing but good could happen to him , even in God 's wrathful storms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley , he was unafraid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Aggie might fly into a closet , shut the door and bury her head in the clothes ; he dared to wait for the lightning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he was good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He clenched his fists and faced the terror .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thunder crashed ; barrels tumbled down the mountainsides , and bounced and bounced till their own fury split them open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lightning might strike the steeples of the other churches ; not of Drew Church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A flash illumined the trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Violet whinnied from the stable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He ran out into the downpour , sped across the yard and into the buggy room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't be afraid , Violet '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">he shouted , and was aghast at the echoes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Do n't you be afraid '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He would save her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If there was a fire or a flood he would save Mama first and Violet next .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Drenched and shaking , he stood near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't you be afraid , Violet '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After the storm , the sky cleared blue and cool , and fragrant air swept the hills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the sun came out , Stevie strode proudly into Orange Square , smiling like a landlord on industrious tenants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The fountain had brimmed over , the cannon were wet , the soldiers ' monument glistened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Even before the benches had dried , the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their places .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The great spire shone as if the lightning had polished it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He jumped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pointed shadow had nearly touched him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He trailed Ludie to the baseball game in the lot on Kingston Street near the Dutch Reformed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Go on home '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ludie screeched at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Someone 'll tell Papa '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No one told on Ludie , not even when he slipped live grasshoppers into the mite-box .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ludie did as he pleased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot at crows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ludie chewed roofer 's tar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ludie had a cigar box full of marbles and shooters , and a Roman candle from last Fourth of July .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ludie hopped rides on freight cars , and was chased by Mr. Yankton , the railroad guard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He came home overheated , ran straight to the ice-chest , and gulped shivery cold water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stevie envied him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That Ludie !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He , too , cocked his cap at a jaunty angle , jingled marbles in his pocket , and swaggered down Main Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the Christophers ' lawn , little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at a tea party .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A Newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stevie yearned for a dog .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wondered whether God had a dog in the sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He meandered down Pike Street , past the First National Bank with its green window shades .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He crossed the tracks to Delaware House , where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A tall lady , with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom , turned insolent green eyes upon him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was taller than Aggie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fiddles screeched ; a piano tinkled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` P.J. '' - as Ludie called the town - was crowded with summer people who came to the mountains to escape the heat in the big cities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They stayed at hotels and boardinghouses , or at private homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rich people went to Delaware House , Opera House , American House or Fowler House .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the crummy bastard could write !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's how it should be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's those two fucken niggers !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Krist , I wish they could write !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nigger pussy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oh , sweet land of heaven , haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He thought of her , the first one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had caught her coming out of the shack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was a juicy one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oh how they bounced !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fresh , warm , sweet and juicy , sweet lovin sixteen , she was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Man how I love nigger pussy !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The snow came a little faster now , he noted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He thought of Joe Harris , the nigger who had gone after his sister .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He chuckled , the memory vivid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jee - sus , We Fixed him !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yooee , we fixed him !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The snow again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If only the fucken weather was n't so lousy !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Goddamn niggers , Lord .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What I have to put up with !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sonuvabitch , I can n't figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only one worth a shit , and that 's Brandon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He ai n't so bad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His thoughts turned to other things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kaboom for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had been pretty scared himself , wondering what the hell was coming off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Soon came back to his senses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I soon came back to my senses '' , he said , aloud , to the young blizzard , proudly , drawing himself up , as if making a report to some important superior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I was the first to get my squad on the ball , and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Look at thum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That goddamn redheader was the worst .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He kept sayin , not me , not me , I do n't wanta wind up like em .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I told him , goddammit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I told him '' , he said aloud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They 'll get the guys that done it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 'll put the place back to normal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Normal , by God .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe it 's a good thing it happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe they 'll stop it now , once for all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Clean the place up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They 're doin it now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They 'll get the guys that done it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was something troubling him though : as yet they had n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Five days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Keerist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His eyes blinked hard , snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A tune began to whirl inside his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of his favorites : `` Guitar Boogie '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It always came on , faithfully , just like a radio or juke box , whenever he started to worry too much about something , when the bad things tried to push their way into him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The music drove them off , or away , and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments , humming and jiving within , beating the rhythm within .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Turn the bastards over to me - to me and my boys - no nigger ever got what would be comin to them - reactionary bastards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a POW began .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It was a word he was proud of , a word that meant much to him , and he used it with great pleasure , almost as if it were an exclusive possession , and more : he sensed himself to be very highly educated , four cuts above any of the folks back home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Four cuts at least '' , he chuckled to himself , `` and I owe it all to them '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The word also made him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so labeled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It came up again and again in the discussion sessions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lousy Reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hired , hard lackeys of the Warmongering Capitalists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not captured , sent here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To fuck up the Program .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You guys remember that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Remember that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He heard himself haranguing them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw himself before them delivering the speech .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He laughed , suddenly , feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One day , Ching had told him ( smiling , patting him on the back ) as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders , `` Keep it up , your squad is good , one of the best , keep it up , keep up the good work '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was really something , coming from Ching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Really something '' , he said , aloud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` They 'll get them by God and let them bring them down here to me , just let them , God I 'll slice their balls right off '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His arm moved swiftly , violently , once , twice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He felt intense satisfaction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was tingling within .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before him , mutilated , bleeding to death , they lay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was as if it had been done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Bastards '' , he said aloud , spitting on them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He halted , and looked around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The thought came back , the one nagging at him these past four days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He tried to stifle it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the words were forming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He knew he could n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He braced himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Somebody 'll hafta start thinkin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He fought it , seeking to kill the last few words , but on they came `` bout takin - his '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was trembling , a strange feeling upon him , fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it did n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he took heart ; the final word came forth `` place '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now he heard it , fully : `` bout takin his place '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He listened , waited , nothing happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He felt good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His old self .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The music arrived , taking him , its rhythm stroked him , snaked all through him , the lyrics lifted him , took him from one magic isle to another , stopping briefly at each .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brandon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is good .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jesus , the guy says he is trying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he is n't with it , not at all with it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I talked to Ching about it , he said , Everyone can learn , if he is not a Reactionary or lazy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one is stupid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's what he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He oughta know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is plain as hell Johnson is no Reactionary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So you 're not tryin , Johnson , you bastard you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave of revulsion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How he loathed him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sleepy-eyed , soft-spoken Johnson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was the guy what always goofed at Question Time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why could n't they have dumped him off on someone else ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why me ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why did n't the damn Reactionaries bump him off ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why Slater ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The music surged up , but it failed to check it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who is the man to take His place ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The guy with most on the Ball .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most on the Ball .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Handle men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thoroughly Wised Up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Knows the score .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With a supreme effort , he broke it off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He turned to the window again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A gnawing and gnashing within him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The snow was tumbling down furiously now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground , piling higher and higher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stared at it , amazed , alarmed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The whole fucken sky 's cavin in !</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin , practically spitting on him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man moved away .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He snuggled into the blanket * * h Brandon dreamed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The log was spinning .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So what ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( he asked this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He could n't make out what he was saying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No doubt it had to do with the log .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Why should he be concerned ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rousseau is so persuasive that Voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But while the two men are riding into the country , where they are going to dinner , they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of thieves , who strip them of everything , including most of their clothes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You must be a very learned man '' , says Voltaire to one of the bandits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` A learned man '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the bandit laughs in his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Voltaire perseveres .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He goes to the chief himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` At what university did you study '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He refuses to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher institution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` To have become so corrupt '' , he says , `` surely you must have studied many arts and sciences '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The chief , annoyed by these questions , knocks Voltaire down and shouts at him that he not only never went to any school , but never even learned how to read .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When finally the two bedraggled men reach their friend 's home , Voltaire 's fears are once again aroused .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For it is such a distinguished place , with such fine works of art and such a big library , that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become depraved by all this culture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To Voltaire 's surprise , however , their host gives them fresh clothes to put on , opens his purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Immediately after dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Could he have pen and paper , please ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is in a hurry to write another essay against culture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans Souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe , to be printed sometime later , but with the name of Timon of Athens , the famous misanthrope , substituted for that of Rousseau .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How cruel !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But at the same time how understandable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">How could the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges , the lies , the frauds , the errors , sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How , for example , could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau would find himself when , soon after the furor of his first Discourse , he acquired still another title to fame ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This time as a musician .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a composer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it , Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But his facility in this genre was not great .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And his efforts to get a performance for his Gallant Muses invariably failed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And for good reasons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His operatic music had little merit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But then one day , while on a week 's visit to the country home of a retired Swiss jeweler , Rousseau amused the company with a few little melodies he had written , to which he attached no great importance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Put a few such songs together '' , they urged him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` String them onto some sort of little plot , and you 'll have a delightful operetta '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did n't believe them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Nonsense '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` This is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Heaven forbid '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">cried the ladies , enchanted by his music .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You must make an opera out of this material '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And they would n't leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oh , the irony and the bitterness of it !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That after all his years of effort to become a composer , he should now , now when he was still stoutly replying to the critics of his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences , be so close to a success in music and have to reject it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Or at least appear to reject it !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But what else could he do ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You could n't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time practice them , could you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Well , yes , perhaps in literature , since you could argue that you could n't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But now music too ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That would be too much !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the fault , of course , was Rameau 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The fault was Rameau 's and that of the whole culture of this Parisian age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For it was Rameau 's type of music that he had been trying to write , and that he could n't write .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">These little songs , however , were sweet nothings from the heart , tender memories of his childhood , little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But no .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He could n't appear as a composer now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That glory , craved for so long , was now forbidden to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , just for the ladies , and just for this once , for this one weekend in the country , he would make a little piece out of his melodies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But then , after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite , standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The ladies especially could n't understand what troubled him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A contradiction ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bah , what was a contradiction in one 's life ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes , and saying yes when she meant no .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Rousseau had to admit that though he could n't agree to a public performance , he would indeed , just for his own private satisfaction , dearly love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Duclos , the historian , pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The musicians of the Royal Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Merely to satisfy the author 's curiosity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rousseau agreed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he recalled that Rameau had once had a private performance of his opera Armide , behind closed doors , just for himself alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Duclos understood what was bothering Rousseau : that the writer of the Prosopopoeia of Fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That would certainly be paradoxical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Duclos thought he saw a way out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Let me do the submitting to the Royal Academy '' , he suggested .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Your name will never appear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one will even suspect that it is your work '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To that Rousseau could agree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Afraid at one and the same time that his work might be turned down - which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author - and that the work would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All these emotions were screwed up to new heights when , after acceptance and the first rehearsals , there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King 's amusements , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Imagine the honor of it !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What was your answer '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jean Jacques asked , striving to appear unimpressed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I refused '' , Duclos said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What else could I do ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Monsieur de Cury was incensed , of course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I said I would first have to get the author 's permission .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And I was certain he would refuse '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How infuriating all this was !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his Discourse , and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity and denial ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now , when everything was opening up to him - even the court of Louis / 15 15 , !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- he had to play a role of self-effacement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Back and forth Duclos had to go , between M. de Cury and Jean Jacques and between the Duke d'Aumont and Jean Jacques again , as his little operetta , The Village Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took on ever more importance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The furor was such that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He felt himself now , as he himself says in his Confessions , at a crucial point of his life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And that was why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace , he did not bother to shave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Seeing him in that condition , and about to enter the hall where the King , the Queen , the whole royal family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present , Grimm and the Abbe Raynal and others tried to stop him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You can n't go in that way '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">they cried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why not '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jean Jacques asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Who is going to stop me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You have n't dressed for the occasion '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">they pointed out to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm dressed as I always am '' , Rousseau said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Neither better nor worse '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` At home , yes '' , they argued .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But here you are in the palace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There 's the King .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And Madame de Pompadour '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` If they are here , then surely I have the right to be here '' , Rousseau said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` And even more right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since I am the composer '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But in such a slovenly condition '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What is slovenly about me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rousseau asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Surely it would grow there whether I washed myself or not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A hundred years ago I would have worn a beard with pride .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And those without beards would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now times have changed , and I must pretend that hair does n't grow on my face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's the fashion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And fashion is the real king here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not Louis / 15 , , since even he obeys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , if you do n't mind , I should like to hear my own piece performed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But of course behind his boldness he did n't feel bold at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He trembled lest his piece should fail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His fear of making some inane or inappropriate remark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And even deeper than that :
his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Could he walk out in the midst of his piece ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here , before the court ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before the King ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The rider from Concord was as good as his word .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He came spurring and whooping down the road , his horse kicking up clouds of dust , shouting :
`` They 're a-coming !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By God , they 're a-coming , they are '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">We heard him before he ever showed , and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Solomon Chandler had n't misjudged the strength of his lungs , not at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">That 's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As for this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can n't say ; but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall , and this dashing rider made us feel a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us , and we crouched behind it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whatever we felt about the redcoats , we respected them in terms of their trade , which was killing ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wanted to wipe my flint , but I did n't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I did n't dare to do anything about the priming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The gun would fire or not , just as chance willed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun , because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The gunfire , which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now , stopped for long enough to count to twenty ; and in that brief interval , a redcoat officer came tearing down the road , whipping his horse fit to kill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do n't know whether he was after our rider , who had gone by a minute before , or whether he was simply scouting conditions ; but when he passed us by , a musket roared , and he reared his horse , swung it around , and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was a fine and showy rider , but his skill was wasted on us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From above me and somewhere behind me , a rifle cracked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster , and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle , except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Half crazed by the weight dragging , the dust , and the heat , the horse leaped our wall , dashing out the rider 's brains against it , and leaving him lying there among us - while the horse crashed away through the brush .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And now the redcoats were coming , and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when I remember back to what happened then , each event is a separate and frozen incident .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In my recollection , there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats , and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds , and then the front of the British army came into view .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was only hours since I had last seen them , but they had changed and I had changed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the very front rank , two men were wounded and staggered along , trailing blood behind them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No drummers here , no pipers , and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They marched with bayonets fixed , and as fixed on their faces was anger , fear , and torment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rank after rank of them came down the road , and the faces were all the same , and they walked in a sea of dust .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Committeemen , hold your fire !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hold your fire '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">a voice called , and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant , only some of them glancing toward the stone wall , from behind which the voice came .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The front of their column had already passed us , when another officer came riding down the side of the road , not five paces from where we were .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My Cousin Simmons carried a musket , but he had loaded it with bird shot , and as the officer came opposite him , he rose up behind the wall and fired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One moment there was a man in the saddle ; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks , and during the next second or two , we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One moment , the road was filled with disciplined troops , marching four by four with a purpose as implacable as death ; the next , a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound , out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the course of this , they had fired on us ; but I have no memory of that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound , hurling more vile language than I ever thought I knew , sobbing and shouting , and aware that if I had passed water before , it was not enough , for my pants were soaking wet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would have stood there and died there if left to myself , but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there ; and then I came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin Simmons by far .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everyone else was running .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac - except the Reverend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball , as Isaac had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile , I reloaded my gun , as the other men were doing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We were less than a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wherever you looked , you saw Committeemen running across the meadows , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty militia were making their way in our direction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cousin Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I did n't offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While this was being discussed , we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle of the North Bridge , which entitled them to a sort of veteran status , and we felt that if they employed this tactic , it was likely enough the best one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mattathias Dover said :
`` It makes sense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">If we cluster together , the redcoats can make an advantage out of it , but there 's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us , and we can outrun them '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That settled it , and we broke into parties of two and three .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cousin Joshua Dover decided to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac Pitt until life passed away - and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I went off with Cousin Simmons , who maintained that if he did n't see to me , he did n't know who would .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Good heavens , Adam '' , he said , `` I thought one thing you 'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I learned that now '' , I said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We ran east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road , panting from the effort and soaked with sweat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road , and the shouting and gunfire never slackened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under the trees , there was a dead redcoat , a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimples , who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three men were around him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had stripped him of his musket and equipment , and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cousin Simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` God's name , what are you to rob the dead with the fight going on '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cousin Simmons roared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They tried to outface him , but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men , and it would have taken braver men than these were to outface him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That summer the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre Ameaux , a gaming-card manufacturer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dancing was no longer permitted in the streets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The slit breeches had to go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Drunkenness was no longer tolerated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In defiance , a chinless reprobate , Jake Camaret , marched down the aisle in St. Peter 's one Sunday morning , followed by one of the women from the Bordel , whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Plunking themselves down on the front bench , they turned to smirk at those around them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John 's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Calmly he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He finished the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor God and man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The next morning , as the clock struck nine , he appeared at the Council meeting in the Town Hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the Church was to be respected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur Favre said rudely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Stick to the preaching of the Gospel '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John stiffened in anger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` That is the answer the ungodly will always make when the Church points its fingers at their sins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I say to you that the Church will ever decry evil '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John 's reply was like a declaration of war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Monsieur Favre sat down in his high-backed stall , lips compressed , eyes glinting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ablard Corne , a short man with a rotunda of stomach , rose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Every eye was on him as he began to speak .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What Master Calvin says is true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How can we have a good city unless we respect morality '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Abel Poupin , a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes , got to his feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` We all know that Jake Camaret and the woman are brazenly living together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Philibert Berthelier , the son of the famous patriot , disagreed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do not listen to that Frenchman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John was quietly insistent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There can be no compromise when souls are in jeopardy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A week later the sentence of the Council was carried out : Jake Camaret and the woman were marched naked through the streets past a mocking populace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before them stalked the beadle , proclaiming as he went , `` Thus the Council deals with those who break its laws - adulterers , thieves , murderers , and lewd persons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let evildoers contemplate their ways , and let every man beware '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John 's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister Mary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Charles had died two weeks before , in early November , without being reconciled to the Church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The canons , in a body , had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last rites of the Church , but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Burial had taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet , so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Abbot of St. Eloi , Claude de Mommor , had been a good friend , but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in hallowed ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">John closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother 's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The blue draped Virgin was still there , but no one knelt before her now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not even Varnessa ; she , too , prayed only to God .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte , the touch of his mother 's hand , the lilt of Charles 's voice in the square raftered rooms , his father 's bass tones rumbling to the canons , and the sight of the beloved bishop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he had to follow the light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy Scriptures , why had He given them to him ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The white clad trees stood like specters in the February night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Snow buried the streets and covered the slanting rooftops , as John trudged toward St. Peter 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A carriage crunched by , its dim lights filtering through the gloom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes , his only ones , now patched with folded parchment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The city had recently given him a small salary , but it was not enough to supply even necessities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As he neared the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black cape whisked by .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John recognized Ablard Corne and called out a greeting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How grateful he was to such men !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were several on the Council who tried to live like Christians .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite their efforts , the problems seemed to grow graver all the time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Quickening his steps , John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John leaned upon the stone balustrade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor 's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Below the moon splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , then down at the blinking lights below .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` How long , my Lord ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How long ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have never asked for an easy task , but I am weary of the strife '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sleep was difficult these days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indigestion plagued him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Severe headaches were frequent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Loneliness tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of Peter Robert , Nerien , Nicholas Cop , Martin Bucer , and even the compromising Louis du Tillet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An occasional traveler from Italy brought news of Peter Robert , who was now distributing his Bible among the Waldensian peasants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Letters came regularly from Nerien , Nicholas , and Martin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had Anthony and William to confide in and consult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But William continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and tearing down symbols sacred to the Old Church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John found it difficult , but he held him in check .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And Anthony was busy most of the time courting this girl and that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His easy good looks made him a favorite with the ladies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Geneva , instead of becoming the City of God , as John had dreamed , had in the two years since he had been there , continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Refugees poured in , signing the Confession and rules in order to remain , and then disregarding them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dice rolled , prostitutes plied their trade , thieves stole , murderers stabbed , and the ungodly blasphemed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded : `` Are we going to allow the Protestant Pope , Master Calvin , to curtail our liberty ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why , oh why , does n't he stick to preaching the Gospel , instead of meddling in civic affairs , politics , economics , and social issues that are no concern of the Church '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And John 's reply was always the same : `` Anything that affects souls is the concern of the Church !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We will have righteousness '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unless the confusion cleared , he would not be coming here much longer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Monsieur Favre 's threat would become a reality , for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that Frenchman '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Faint at first , the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eli Corault !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is he doing here at this hour ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He started down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher , who had been one of the early Gospelers in Paris .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` John ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is that you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I came to warn you of a plot '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John stood above him , his face ashen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What now ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Slowly , like a man grown old , he took Eli 's hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Plot '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John asked tiredly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I went to your rooms , and Anthony told me you were here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two Anabaptists , Caroli and Benoit , are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is to be a trap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You know the law : if you lose the debate after accepting a challenge , you will be banished '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What will be the subject '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Anger and fear fused in John .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of Christ .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those who refused to believe that He was the eternal Son of God were termed Arianists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Peter Caroli had come to Geneva , saying that he had been a bishop of the Church of Rome and had been persecuted in Paris for his Reformed faith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He asked to be appointed a preacher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But Michael Sept had unmasked him , revealing he had never been a bishop , but was an Anabaptist , afraid to state his faith , because he knew John Calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now Caroli sought revenge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John sighed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` If William agrees , we should insist on a public debate '' , he said at length .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There is more to the conspiracy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bern demands that the Lord's Supper be administered here as it used to be , with unleavened bread .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore , Bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council , preach only the word of God and stop meddling in politics '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It was always the spirit with Christ ; matters such as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Geneva must remain a sovereign state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We will not yield to the demands of Bern '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The firelight played over Eli 's flowing white locks and rugged features .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Monsieur Favre indicated that if I would co-operate , after you and William are banished , following the debate , I will be given a place of influence '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` What was your reply to that '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` That I would rather be banished with two such Christians than be made the Chief Syndic '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following morning , as John entered the Place Molard on his way to visit a sick refugee , he had a premonition of danger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He wanted to run , but he knew that if he did , he would be lost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He stood very still , his heart thumping wildly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the outskirts of the rabble the Camaret brothers and Gaspard Favre shook their fists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Are you going to comply with the demands of Bern '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the chinless Jake called .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Arianist '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">a rowdy with a big blob of a nose roared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Heretic '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John lifted his hand for silence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Know this : the ministers will not yield to the demands of Bern '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His voice shook a little .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Somebody heaved a stone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For an instant John was stunned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When he felt the side of his head , his fingers came away covered with blood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Before he could duck , another stone struck him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` let him be now '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pierre Ameaux , the gaming-card manufacturer said , his little pig eyes glaring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We have taught him a lesson '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The crowd moved back and John started dizzily down the hill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At once a bevy of dogs was snapping and snarling around him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One , more horrible than the rest , lunged , growling deep in his throat , his hair bristling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With great difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run , sweat pouring down his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Standing in the shelter of the tent - a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no longer drumming - Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beef barrels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was , of course , no real need to rearrange everything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardines , or the bitters , or the condensed milk , or the stationery , or the needles - what could it mean ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Adam watched his own hands make the caressing , anxious movement that , when rain falls and nobody comes , and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the ankles , has been the ritual of stall vendors , forever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He recognized the gesture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He knew its meaning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had seen a dry , old , yellowing hand reach out , with that painful solicitude , to touch , to rearrange , to shift aimlessly , some object worth a pfennig .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Back in Bavaria he had seen that gesture , and at that sight his heart had always died within him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand , whatever face it might be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now the face was his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wondered what expression , as he made that gesture , was on his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He wondered if it wore the old anxiety , or the old , taut stoicism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But there was no need , he remembered , for his hand to reach out , for his face to show concern or stoicism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then why was he assuming the role - the gesture and the suffering ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What was he expiating ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or was he now taking the role - the gesture and the suffering - because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid , befogged loneliness of this land .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was Virginia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked out of the tent at the company street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beyond that misty gray of the rain , he saw the stretching hutment , low diminutive log cabins , chinked with mud , with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through , with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes , or fence rails , with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The smoke from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other , and hung as sadly in the drizzle , creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Over the door was a board with large , inept lettering :
Home Sweet Home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was the hut of Simms Purdew , the hero .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The men were huddled in those lairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Adam knew the names of some .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He knew the faces of all , hairy or shaven , old or young , fat or thin , suffering or hardened , sad or gay , good or bad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When they stood about his tent , chaffing each other , exchanging their obscenities , cursing command or weather , he had studied their faces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had had the need to understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh , behind the oath , the banter , the sadness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Once covertly looking at Simms Purdew , the only man in the world whom he hated , he had seen the heavy , slack , bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel , obscene banter , and had seen the pale blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment , and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that vile creature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was seeing , somehow , the face of a young boy , the boy Simms Purdew must once have been , a boy with sorrel hair , and blue eyes dancing with gaiety , and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">In that moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying : I must not hate him , I must not hate him or I shall die .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His heart suddenly opened to joy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He thought that if once , only once , he could talk with Simms Purdew , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If Simms Purdew would turn to him and say : `` Adam , you know when I was a boy , it was a funny thing happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lemme tell you now '' -
If only Simms Purdew could do that , whatever the thing he remembered and told .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be a sign for the untellable , and he , Adam , would understand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choking the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw the sign above the door of the hut : Home Sweet Home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street , with an armful of wood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was Pullen James , the campmate of Simms Purdew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He carried the wood , carried the water , did the cooking , cleaning and mending , and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his pains .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam , like metal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pullen James humbly lowered his head , pushed aside the hardtack box door of the hut , and was gone from sight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adam stared at the door and remembered that Simms Purdew had been awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry at Antietam .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The street was again empty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The drizzle was slacking off now , but the light was grayer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With enormous interest , Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Into the emptiness of the street , and his spirit , moved a form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The form was swathed in an army blanket , much patched , fastened at the neck with a cord .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From under the shapeless huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The feet wore army shoes , in obvious disrepair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The head was wrapped in a turban and on top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been flung .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moisture ran down the cheeks , gathered at the tip of the nose , and at the chin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the drop clinging there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The figure stopped and one hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then the figure moved on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was one of the Irish women who had built their own huts down near the river .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They did washing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adam recognized this one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He recognized her because she was the one who , in a winter twilight , on the edge of camp , had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Slice o ' mutton , bhoy '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she had queried in her soft guttural .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Slice o ' mutton '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her name was Mollie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They called her Mollie the Mutton , and laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Looking down the street after her , Adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He could not make out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mollie the Mutton was scratching her nose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The words ran crazily in his head : Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then the words fell into a pattern : `` Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose , Scratching her nose in the rain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pattern would not stop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It came again and again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He felt trapped in that pattern , in the repetition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Suddenly he thought he might weep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What 's the matter with me '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he demanded out loud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked wildly around , at the now empty street , at the mud , at the rain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , what 's the matter with me '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he demanded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When he had stored his stock in the great oak chest , locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain , tied the fly of the tent , and picked up the cash box , he moved up the darkening street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would consign the cash box into the hands of Jed Hawksworth , then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he -
Then what ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His mind closed on that prospect , as though fog had descended to blot out a valley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Far off , in the dusk , he heard voices singing , muffled but strong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In one of the huts a group of men were huddled together , singing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stopped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He strained to hear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He heard the words : `` Rock of Ages , cleft for me , Let me hide myself in Thee !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let the water and the blood From Thy riven side '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He thought : I am a Jew from Bavaria .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was standing there , he thought , in Virginia , in the thickening dusk , in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another Jew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That other Jew , a young man too , had left that greatcoat behind , in a rich house , and marched away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had crossed the river which now , beyond the woods yonder , was sliding darkly under the mist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had plunged into the dark woods beyond .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had died there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What had that man , that other young Jew , felt as he stood in the twilight and heard other men , far away , singing together ?
.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adam thought of the hutments , regiment after regiment , row after row , the thousands of huts , stretching away into the night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought of the men , the nameless thousands , huddling in them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought of Simms Purdew snoring on his bunk while Pullen James crouched by the hearth , skirmishing an undershirt for lice , and a wet log sizzled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought of Simms Purdew , who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield , a maniacal scream on his lips , and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought of Simms Purdew rising up , fearless in glory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He felt the sweetness of pity flood through him , veining his very flesh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They did not know who they were or know their own worth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the pity for them his loneliness was gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he thought of Aaron Blaustein standing in his rich house saying : `` God is tired of taking the blame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is going to let History take the blame for a while '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought of the old man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought : Only in my heart can I make the world hang together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw Mose squatting by the hearth , breaking up hardtack into a pan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A pot was boiling on the coals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Done give Ole Buckra all his money '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mose asked softly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adam nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah '' , Mose murmured , `` yeah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And look what he done give us '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adam looked at the pot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What is it '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Chicken '' , Mose said , and theatrically licked his lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Gre't big fat chicken , yeah '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He licked his lips again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then : `` Yeah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A chicken with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And hit squealed for slop '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mose giggled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Fooled you , huh ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is the same ole same , tell me hit 's name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is sowbelly with tits on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is salt po'k .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is salt po'k and skippers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That po'k , it was so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say , ' Hoo-pig ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Had to put my foot on it to hole it down while I cut it up fer the lob-scuse '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boiling pot of lobscouse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Good ole lob-scuse '' , he mumbled , and stirred the pot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Know what Ole Buckra et tonight '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he demanded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Know what I had to fix fer Ole Him '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adam shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Chicken '' , Mose said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was a child too much a part of her environment , too eager to grow and learn and experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once , they were at Easthampton for the summer ( again , Fritzie said , a good place , even though they were being robbed ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One soft evening - that marvelous sea blessed time when the sun 's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts everything - Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fritzie was on the couch reading ; Laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The infant , in white terry-cloth bathrobe , her face intense and purposeful , had essayed a few wobbly steps toward her father .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Y'all wanna walk - walk '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , gently , he shoved her behind toward Laura .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Amy walked - making it halfway across the cottage floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She lost not a second , picking herself up and continuing her pilgrimage to Laura .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Laura took her gently and shoved her off again , toward Fritzie :
Amy did not laugh - this was work , concentration , achievement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a few minutes she was making the ten foot hike unaided ; soon she was parading around the house , flaunting her new skill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Some liar 's logic , a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the window ( a euphoria perhaps engendered by the pill Fritzie had given her ) , consoled her for a moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Amy had to be safe , had to come back to them - if only to reap that share of life 's experiences that were her due , if only to give her parents another chance to do better by her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Through the swathings of terror , she jabbed deceit 's sharp point - Amy would be reborn , a new child , with new parents , living under new circumstances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The comfort was short-lived , yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Gazing at her husband 's drugged body , his chest rising and falling in mindless rhythms , she saw the grandeur of his fictional world , that lush garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She envied him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She admired him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the darkness , she saw him stirring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He seemed to be muttering , his voice surprisingly clear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Y'all should have let me take that money out '' , Andrus said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` ' Nother minute I 'd have been fine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Y'all should have let me do it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Laura touched his hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , I know , Fritzie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I should have '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The heat intensified on Tuesday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Southern California gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell , drier , more enervating , more laden with man 's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It could continue this way , hitting 106 and more in the Valley , Joe McFeeley knew , into October .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He and Irvin Moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Both had been up since 7 : 00 - Irv on the early morning watch , McFeeley unable to sleep during his four hour relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The night before , they had telephoned the Andrus maid , Selena Masters , and she had arrived early , bursting her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley and confounded Moll .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The latter , thanking her for the coffee , had winked and muttered , `` Sure ' nuff , honey '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Selena was the wrong woman for these crudities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With a hard eye , she informed Moll : `` Do n't sure ' nuff me , officer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm honey only to my husband , understand '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sergeant Moll understood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The maid was very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique uniform .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her speech was barren of southernisms ; she was one of Eliot Sparling 's neutralized minorities , adopting the rolling R 's and constricted vowels of Los Angeles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not seeing her dark intelligent face , one would have gauged the voice as that of a Westwood Village matron , ten years out of Iowa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After she had served the detectives coffee and toast ( they politely declined eggs , uncomfortable about their tenancy ) , she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock market quotations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While she was thus engaged , McFeeley questioned her about her whereabouts the previous day , any recollections she had of people hanging around , of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen , of strange cars cruising the neighborhood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She answered him precisely , missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Selena Masters , Joe realized , was her own woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was the only kind of Negro Laura Andrus would want around : independent , unservile , probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework - and doubly efficient .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the parents emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later , the maid greeted them quietly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm awful sorry about what 's happened '' , Selena said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Maybe today 'll be a good news day '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She charged off to the bedrooms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moll took his coffee into the nursery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During the night , a phone company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Someone would have to remain in the office continually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">McFeeley greeted the parents , then studied his notebook .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wanted to take the mother to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sleep well '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrus did not answer him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His face was bloated with drugging , redder than normal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The woman had the glassy look of an invalid , as if she had not slept at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh - we managed '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm a little groggy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did anything happen during the night '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Few crank calls '' , McFeeley said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` A couple of tips we 're running down - nothing promising .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We can expect more of the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Too bad your number is in the directory '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Did n't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when I had it listed '' , Andrus muttered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He settled on the sofa with his coffee , warming his hands on the cup , although the room was heavy with heat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The three had little to say to each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The previous night 's horror - the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusions of the press , had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness , of play-acting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sipping their coffee , discussing the weather , the day 's shopping , Fritzie 's commitments at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news show , even the front page of the Santa Luisa Register , resting on the kitchen bar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kidnapper Spurns Ransom ; Amy Still Missing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once , Andrus walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five column lead of the article ( by Duane Bosch , staff correspondent - age not given ) , and muttered : `` We a buncha national celebrities '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to police headquarters in a half hour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did not want to bring the Andruses to the station house too early - Rheinholdt had summoned a press conference , and he did n't want them subjected to the reporters again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could think of nothing else to tell them : no assurances , no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the detective left , Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Andrus was talking to the maid , arranging for her to come in every day , instead of the four days she now worked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Outside , only a handful of reporters remained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bulk of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt 's conference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In contrast to the caravan of the previous night , there were only four cars parked across the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two men he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did not see Sparling , or DeGroot , or Ringel , or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , the litter remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The street cleaner had not yet been around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One of the reporters called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And he ignored him , skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the Skopas house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When McFeeley was halfway to the door , the proprietor emerged - a mountainous , dark man , his head thick with resiny black hair , his eyes like two of the black olives he imported in boatloads .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">McFeeley identified himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The master of the house , his nourished face unrevealing , consented to postpone his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Inside , as soon as Mr. Skopas had disclosed - in a hoarse whisper - the detective 's errand , his family gathered in a huddle , forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of a baroque fireplace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps , they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was amazing how they had herded together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They answered him in monosyllables , nods , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , awaiting the word from Papa , who restlessly cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No , they had n't seen anyone around ; no , they did n't know the Andrus family ; yes , they had read about the case ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no longer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They offered no opinions , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children had no unhappy romances , whose names never knew scandal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The equation was simple : wealth brought them happiness , and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no one in on the secrets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By comparison , Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering fledglings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They possessed no outer fortifications , no hard shells of confidence ; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day , let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Skopas expressed no curiosity over the case , offered no expression of sympathy , made no move to escort McFeeley to the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had spoken to Mrs. Emerson the previous day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There remained a family named Kahler , owners of a two story Tudor style house on the south side of the Andrus home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their names had not come up in any discussions with Laura , and he had no idea what they would be like .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">McFeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens : each blade of grass cropped , bright and firm ; each shrub glazed with good health .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The door was answered by a slender man in his sixties - straight backed , somewhat clerical in manner , wearing rimless glasses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Joe identified himself , he nodded , unsmiling , and ushered him into a sedate living room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Kahler joined them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had a dried-out quality - a gray , lean woman , not unattractive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both were dressed rather formally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man wore a vest and a tie , the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands of pearls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Funny thing '' , Mr. Kahler said , when they were seated , `` when I heard you ringing , I figured it was that guy down the block , Hausman '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">McFeeley looked puzzled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kahler continued : `` I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he 's sore , so I expected him to come barging in '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Kahler went on to explain how Hausman 's fox terrier had been `` making '' in his flower beds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The dog refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would lay in wait in the garage , and when the terrier came scratching around , he 'd let fly with a cherry bomb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Scared the hell out of him '' , Kahler grinned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I hit him in the ass once '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both grinned at the detective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Finally , all I needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was intimidated by the stove .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners for her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The gas flamed up two inches high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They found the teakettle and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Several sections of a loaf of dark bread ; butter ; jam ; a tiny cake of ice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver , they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While she was settling the teacart , he went back across the hall to their bedroom , opened one of the suitcases , and took out powdered coffee and sugar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do you want to call Eugene '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did n't , but it was not really a question , and so he left the room , walked down the hall to the front of the apartment , hesitated , and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A sleepy voice answered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Le petit dejeuner '' , Harold said , in an accent that did credit to Miss Sloan , his high-school French teacher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the same time , his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here , and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable , peace-loving , and dependable in everybody .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was impossible , it was at least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread and butter , and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Stirring , he said : `` I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his cup and filled it with hot water , and then , stirring , he sat back in his chair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The chair creaked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Every time he moved or said something , the chair creaked again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eugene was not entirely silent , or openly rude - unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It went right on creaking under his own considerable weight , and all it needed , Harold thought , was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Through the open window they heard sounds below in the street : cartwheels , a tired horse 's plodding step , voices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Harold indicated the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eugene told him and he promptly forgot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They passed the marmalade , the bread , the black-market butter , back and forth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nothing was said about hotels or train journeys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eugene offered Harold his car , to use at any time he cared to , and when this offer was not accepted , the armchair creaked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They all three had another cup of coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown , and on his large feet he wore yellow Turkish slippers that turned up at the toes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ex-cuse me '' , he said in Berlitz English , and got up and left them , to bathe and dress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold out into the hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He realized that he had no idea where the telephone was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At that moment the bathroom door flew open and Eugene came out , with his face lathered for shaving , and strode down the hall , tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Harold shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sabine called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow night '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He handed Harold a key to the front door , and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When enough time had elapsed so that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten , Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the room next to theirs was a huge cradle , of mahogany , ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was the most important-looking cradle he had ever seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then came their bathroom , and then a bedroom that , judging by the photographs on the walls , must belong to Mme Cestre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A young woman who looked like Alix , with her two children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alix and Eugene on their wedding day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Matching photographs in oval frames of Mme Bonenfant and an elderly man who must be Alix 's grandfather .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mme Vienot , considerably younger and very different .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The schoolboy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And a gray-haired man whose glance - direct , lifelike , and mildly accusing - was contradicted by the gilt and black frame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Professor Cestre , could it be ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the metal shutters closed , the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas , which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The curtains were of the same material , and there were some big oil paintings - portraits in the style of Lancret and Boucher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Though , taken individually , the big rooms were , or seemed to be , square , the apartment as a whole formed a triangle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The apex , the study where Eugene slept , was light and bright and airy and cheerful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The window looked out on the Place Redoute - it was the only window of the apartment that did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Looking around slowly , he saw a marble fireplace , a desk , a low bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass panes in the doors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The daybed Eugene had slept in , made up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The portable record player with a pile of classical records beside it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beethoven 's Fifth was the one on top .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Da-da-da-dum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Music could not be Eugene 's passion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides , the records were dusty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He tried the doors of the bookcase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Locked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed wires : works on theology , astral physics , history , biology , political science .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No poetry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No novels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He moved over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The clock on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The concierge called out to them as they were passing through the foyer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building , and her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture - a big , round , oak dining table and chairs , a buffet , with a row of unclaimed letters inserted between the mirror and its frame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The suitcases had come while they were out , and had been put in their room , the concierge said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said : `` Now what do we do '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Call the Vouillemont , I guess '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I guess '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered , they had gone sight-seeing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They went to the Flea Market , expecting to find the treasures of Europe , and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in Tours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cheap clothing and junk of every sort , as far as the eye could see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They looked , even so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Looked at everything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Barbara bought some cotton aprons , and Harold bought shoestrings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They had lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad , busy , unpicturesque streets , and coming home they got lost in the Metro ; it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed , in order to take the line that went to the Place Redoute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When he opened the door , there stood Eugene , on his way out of the apartment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was wearing sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt , and in his hand he carried a little black bag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not explain where he was going , and they did not ask .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead , they went on down the hall to their room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do you think he could be having an affair '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Barbara asked , as they heard the front door close .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh no '' , Harold said , shocked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , this is France , after all '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I know , but there must be some other explanation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He 's probably spending the evening with friends '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` And for that he needs a little bag '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They went shopping in the neighborhood , and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given in Blois , and some cheese , and a dozen eggs , and a bag of oranges from a peddler in the Place Redoute - the first oranges they had seen since they landed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had Vermouth , sitting in front of a cafe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment , and thought how , under different circumstances , they might have stayed on here , in these old-fashioned , high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him of the Irelands ' apartment in the East Eighties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went down the hall to Eugene 's bathroom , to turn on the hot-water heater , and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming trunks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He felt them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were damp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He reached out and felt the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Damp also .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked around the room and then called out :
`` Come here , quick '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` What is it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Barbara asked , standing in the doorway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I 've solved the mystery of the little bag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There it is * * h and there is what was in it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But where do people go swimming in Paris ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That boat in the river , maybe '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What boat '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There 's a big boat anchored near the Place de la Concorde , with a swimming pool in it - did n't you notice it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But if he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She looked at him in surprise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I know '' , he said , reading her mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know what I'm going to do with you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's because we are in France '' , he said , `` and know so few people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So something like this matters more than it would at home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also , he was so nice when he was nice '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` All because I did n't feel like dancing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't think it was that , really '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Then what was it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I wish I did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The tweed coat , maybe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The thing about Eugene is that he 's very proud '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance - what about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fortunately , the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And in any case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a hundred pounds ' weight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They took Jesus 's body , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Listed as present at the Descent were Mary , Mary 's sister , Mary Magdalene , John , Joseph of Arimathea , Nicodemus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Search as he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mostly the scene was crowded with mourners , such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna , where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped Mary 's last poignant moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In his concept there could be no one else present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate 's asking for Christ 's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone home to mourn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They would feel what Mary was undergoing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There would be no halos , no angels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These would be two human beings , whom God had chosen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He felt close to Mary , having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; her son was dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even though he would later be resurrected , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother ; only what Mary felt for her son .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jesus ' inert body would be passive , his eyes closed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mary would have to carry the human communication .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This seemed right to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since his Christ was to be life size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His Mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was only one way to accomplish this : by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He improvised as he went along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` So that 's sculpture '' , commented Argiento wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor for a week , `` making mud pies '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Michelangelo grinned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` See , Argiento , if you control the way these folds are bunched , like this , or made to flow , you can enrich the body attitudes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They can have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He went into the Jewish quarter , wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Jewish section was in Trastevere , near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The colony had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 drove many Jews into Rome .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here , for the most part , they were well treated , as a `` reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity '' ; many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican as physicians , musicians , bankers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">The men did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work , but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was told to ask for Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study , a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes , robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Michelangelo explained why he had come , Rabbi Melzi replied gravely :
`` The Bible forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But , Rabbi Melzi , you do n't object to others creating works of art '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each religion has its own tenets '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I cannot accomplish this if you will not help me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The rabbi said thoughtfully , `` I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I am working for the Cardinal of San Dionigi .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I'm sure he would approve '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` What kind of models would you prefer '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Workmen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In their mid thirties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not bulky laborers , but sinewy men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With intelligence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And sensitivity '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rabbi Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Leave me your address .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I will send you the best the quarter has to offer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Michelangelo hurried to Sangallo 's solitary bachelor room with his sketches , asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Together he and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His first model arrived at dusk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He then draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother 's lap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But at the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother roughed in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mary presented quite a different problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman , even as had his memory of his mother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here he sketched , sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk , young girls not yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since the Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy ; but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together : a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death - a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When he wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or subtracted clay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character :
his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; they remained rough starting points .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The true surge had to be inside the marble itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Drawing and models were his thinking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Carving was action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Argiento , this is senseless '' , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're too clean .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scrub the studio once a week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's enough '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' , said Argiento stolidly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Every day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before dawn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was taught '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And God help anyone who tries to unteach you '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">grumbled Michelangelo ; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about , for Argiento made few demands on him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing :
`` Today I go see the horses '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Argiento made him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He assumed he could blink the splinter out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it would not come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Argiento never left his side , keeping the water boiled , applying hot compresses throughout the night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic : he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into Michelangelo 's injured eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The surgeon came back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again washed out the eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The thin legs twitched convulsively once , then Kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The child was gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Juanita awoke , Kate was still rocking the dead child , still crooning in disbelief , `` No , no , oh , no ! ''</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He sat beside Kate 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God 's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs. Tussle came , called by tragedy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It always comes in threes '' , she sighed heavily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Trouble never comes but in threes '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would not accept the death of such a little child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` God called her to Him '' , the minister had said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">God would not do that , Kate thought stubbornly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jonathan 's letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child 's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan 's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She held Jonathan 's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Juanita and Mrs. Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She disciplined herself daily to do what must be done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse 's room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby 's death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Juanita drooped about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby 's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to `` Miss Juanita Fitzroy '' , bearing a Grafton postmark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Seeing the slanting hand , Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended , at what involvement existed for Juanita .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Uncle Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including Annie , had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She loved him and missed his company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What it was Kate could not fathom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies , but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs. Lattimer 's funeral .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Joel knew what he was about , however .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're gonna get caught '' , she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not this old fox '' , chuckled Uncle Randolph .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Everybody knows I'm just a harmless , deaf old man who takes to drink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Whisky still , my foot '' , said Joel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're back there riding with the guerrillas , the Moccasin Rangers '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hush '' , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , `` or I 'll give you another black eye '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stranger , Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing `` Old Dan Tucker '' at the top of his voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold sober .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General McClellan , threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was taken up in worry for the reckless old man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Kate had walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident , had seen Joel 's burning humiliation before Miss Snow 's cold , bespectacled wrath .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had the hardest pains of growing before him now , as he approached twelve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She tried to find some way to draw him out , to help him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He tended the new colts Beau had sired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer 's purple dusk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it ; of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack 's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the B + O Railroad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The men were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in Wheeling , Which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at Cheat and Rich mountains both , and the Federal march on Beverly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They won't never git over inter loyal western Virginia , them traitors !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too '' , he crowed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After he had gone , Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly , `` Would you take their oath '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said , `` Hell , yes !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I think I 've taken it about fifty times already '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">winking at Joel 's look of shock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate 's baby and at Jonathan 's decision to go with the South `` And , dear Kate '' , she wrote , `` poor Dr. Breckenridge 's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South , to his good father 's sorrow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maj. Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the U.S. Army .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral , John Hunt Morgan is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen factory '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight '' , the old man told them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the next few days they had cause to rejoice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It had been a big battle , and the Confederate forces had won .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kate and Mrs. Tussle waited for letters anxiously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had defended her land victoriously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon 's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had already lost most of their corn , she thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Were they to be insulted again because of the South 's great victory ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She remembered McClellan 's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed in the doorway , his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Kate greeted him gravely , uneasy with misgivings at his visit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What brings you here again , Colonel Marsh '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">she asked , taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I stopped to say goodbye , Mrs. Lattimer , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wish our doctor could have saved her '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` It was a terrible loss to me '' , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Where will you go now that you 're leaving Parkersburg '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">she asked him , seeing Juanita 's eyes grow bleak .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` As you know , General McClellan has been occupying Beverly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am to go to Washington to serve with him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` When are you to leave '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Kate asked , watching them both now anxiously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Tomorrow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs. Lattimer '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Stay here in the parlor where it 's cool '' , she said , trying to be calm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs. Tussle not to see them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then she took iced lemonade to Marsh 's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue , Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He wants me to go with him tomorrow '' , she told Kate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What do you want to do '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Kate asked , uneasy at the gravity of the girl 's dilemma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I could go with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He knows me as your niece , which , of course , I am .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I am a slave !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You own me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's your decision '' , said Juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` No , the decision is yours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr. Lattimer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well stuffed pillows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They slept - Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the ballroom below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Martha Schuyler , old , slow , careful of foot , came down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckles held forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , I'm here at last '' , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't hear the music .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am getting deaf , I must admit it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where is everyone ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I say , where is everyone ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Peter , you lummox , you 've forgot to order the musicians '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She stood there , a large old woman , smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were times now , like this , when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was it a birthday ball ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Martha picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">David Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used to horseback .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky 's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem Heights , before morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of Liberty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he would sleep , sleep , and never think of roads and horses ' sore haunches , of colonial wars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Strange how everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mynheer , Sir Francis , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon drenched road .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He pulled out one of them and cocked it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a grotesque hen , five or six feet tall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It ran , this apocalyptic beast , on two thin legs , and its wings - were they feathered arms ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- flapped as it ran .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Its groin was bloody .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Black strips of skin hung from it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">David took a firm hand with it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , glazed with an insane fear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The ungainly bird thing ran away , and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then it was gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He drove on , wary and shaken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Sons were out tonight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From there it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses , estates , and big farms of the original ( non Indian ) landowners began .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island Sound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights , and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences , and there were grazing cattle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers - smugglers - lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They often threw tidbits overboard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The larger ships were near Paulus Hook , already being called , by a few , Jersey City .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These were the ships of His Majesty 's Navy , herding the hulks of the East Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The news of battle on Breed 's Hill had already seeped through , and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fish hawk , his wings not moving , circled and glided lower .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the ports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The captain 's gig of H.M.S. Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S. Neptune .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On shore `` the freed slaves to despotism '' - the town dwellers - watched the ships and waited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The chevaux de frise , those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; their rock paths led down to the Hudson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten Island , gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind which nested farms , cattle barns , and berry thickets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck 's Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Today , tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Waited for more ships , more lobster-backed infantry , and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">David Cortlandt , having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked out at King 's Bridge toward Westchester .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual ; a carriage raising up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drilling with muskets , Kentuck ' rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David 's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pensive , introspective , he ached .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now there was more to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He scratched his mosquito plagued neck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the saddlebags , hung on a Hitchcock chair , David took out a good English razor , a present from John Hunter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He hoped he was free of self-deception .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here he was , suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He knew that many were using it for their own ends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it did not matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stropped the razor slowly ; what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That some men did not want it he could understand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet some , like Morris Manderscheid , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unique circumstances would test us all , he decided .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Injury and ingratitude would occur .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No doubt John Hancock would do well now ; war was a smugglers ' heaven .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And what of that poor tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler 's ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Things like that would increase rather than be done away with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">David began to shave with great sweeping strokes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Time plays an essential part in our mortality , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine ( or admit ) the image of Peg laughing filled his mind - so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuances of pleasure and joy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He drove sensual patterns off , carefully shaving his long upper lip .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is harder , he muttered , to meditate on man ( or woman ) than on God .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">David finished shaving , washed his face clean of lather , and combed and retied his hair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was proud that he had never worn a wig .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">More and more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He felt cheerful again , refreshed ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding boots .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is so easy to falsify sentiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the meadow below , militia officers shouted at their men and on King 's Bridge two boys sat fishing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The future would happen ; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He began to pack the saddlebags .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And all this too shall pass away : it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy - yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley , where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English Dutch manors with their well-fed squires .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Peasants puzzled Andrei .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He wondered how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national leadership , exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Had he found the meaning too late ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It aggravated him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich , but no one seemed to care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies , and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Alexander Brandel rose to speak , the hall became silent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is our singular goal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How we travel through the forest is for each man 's conscience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where we end our journey is always the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We all seek the same thing through different ways - an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex , `` I only want to be a Pole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Warsaw is my city , not Tel Aviv '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Warsaw !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief , Roman , and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They had let this black hole of death in Warsaw 's heart exist without a cry of protest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies ' hands as they flirted from behind their fans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Warsaw !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Warsaw !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Miss Rak .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am a Jew '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Day by day , week by week , month by month , the betrayal gnawed at Andrei 's heart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He ground his teeth together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I hate Warsaw , he said to himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers ' sons of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All of Poland is a coffin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What matters now ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is beyond this fog ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At a siding , another train which was a familiar sight these days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Deportees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jews .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrei 's skilled eye sized them up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were not Poles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of all the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Bathyrans were all gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He and Ana watched it carefully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Early in 1939 , Odilo Globocnik , the Gauleiter of Vienna , established SS headquarters for all of Poland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian administrators .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lublin was the seed of action for the `` final solution '' of the Jewish problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As the messages from Himmler , Heydrich , and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk , Lublin 's fountainhead spouted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A bevy of interlacing lagers , work camps , concentration camps erupted in the area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into Lublin 's web .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Plans went in and out of Lublin , indicating German confusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several million Jews .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of Madagascar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik 's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lipowa 7 , Sobibor , Chelmno , Poltawa , Belzec , Krzywy-Rog , Budzyn , Krasnik .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ice baths , electric shocks , lashings , wild dogs , testicle crushers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Death's-Head Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries , and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken , dope ridden maniacs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lublin was their heart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The ghetto , a miniature of Warsaw 's , was emptied into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As the camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by deportees from outside Poland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In and in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What was happening in Majdanek ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrei stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His watch told him he was still early .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He found an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Captain Androfski '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached , homely face of Sergeant Styka .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I thought you might get in on a morning train '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's good to see you again , Styka '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Styka studied his captain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He almost broke into tears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To him , Andrei Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Remember to call me Jan '' , Andrei said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` When that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Styka grumbled about fate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` For a time I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces , but one thing led to another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not a bad girl .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So we have three children and responsibilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I work at the granary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nothing like the old days in the army , but I get by .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who complains ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many times I tried to reach you , but I never knew how .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I understand '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Styka blew his nose again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Were you able to make the arrangements '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrei asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I did exactly as instructed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in exile in London '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` His answer '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ten thousand zlotys '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Can he be trusted '' ?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Good man , Styka '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Captain Jan , must you go inside Majdanek ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The stories .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps - perhaps - there is a shred of conscience left in the human race .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do you really believe that , Jan '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I have to believe it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Styka shook his head slowly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I am only a simple soldier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I cannot think things out too well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Until I was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I hated you when I first came in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But my captain might have been a Jew , but he was n't a Jew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What I mean is , he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The question frightened Andrei .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm still a soldier in a very small way , Styka '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was an answer that Styka understood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Grabski 's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Grabski sat in a sweat saturated undershirt , cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Half of it dripped down his chin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrei demanded .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I do n't know if I can get you into the inner camp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe yes , maybe no , but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ca n't understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Orders from the Home Army '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nothing there but Jews '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrei shrugged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We get strange orders '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well - what about the money '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Grabski had never seen so much money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His broad flat fingers , petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying , snatched the bills clumsily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` This ai n't enough '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I ai n't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andrei and Styka were silent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was getting real dramatic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I 'd have been more impressed if I had n't remembered that she 'd played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I did n't want her back on that broken record .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Nothing 's free in the whole goddam world '' , was all I could think of to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When I 'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I am '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma 's fifty dollars I was spending .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I was crazy about her all over again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was the call of the wild all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That evening turned out to be hell like all the others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the same old routine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eileen got to dancing , just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she 'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness we 'd had together and there I was back on the hook .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I did have the decency to call up Thelma and tell her I 'd met old friends and would be home late .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I could scratch her eyes out '' , Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came back from the phone booth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You know I do n't like my men to have other women .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I hate it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I hate it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She got so drunk I had to take her home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a walk up on Hudson Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and would n't let me go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a man 's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimp like characters use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What about Ballestre '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I had to shake her to make her listen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Precious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What about him '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We are above being jealous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's used to me bringing home strange men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll just tell him you 're my husband .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He can n't object to that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well I object .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If he pokes his nose in here I 'll slug him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That really would be funny '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She began to laugh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After all I'm made of flesh and blood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm not a plaster saint .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Waking up was horrible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Never in my life have I felt so remorseful about anything I 've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We both had hangovers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eileen declared she could n't lift her head from the pillow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was somebody else in the apartment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I stiffened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog 's that is going to get into a fight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I turned around with the percolator in my hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My eyes were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffy colored fedora .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oval face without an expression in the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We did n't have time to speak before Eileen 's voice was screeching at us from the bed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier Bowman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Exboyfriend meet exhusband '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And do n't either of you forget that I'm not any man 's property .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you want to fight , go down on the sidewalk '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was enjoying the situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Imagine that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eileen was a psychologist all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard I found myself having a fellow-feeling for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe he felt the same way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffee-cup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I could n't face Thelma after that night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I did n't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wrote her that I 'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course I had to give her Eileen 's address , but she never came near us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She never said a word about the fifty dollars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That finished me with Thelma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I felt it and it ate on me all the time , but I did n't know how right I was till later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What I did know was that Precious was always around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Who do you think pays the rent ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You would n't have me throw the poor boy out on the street '' , Eileen said when I needled her about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she did n't want to hear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still I did n't think she was twotiming me with Precious right then .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Precious had me worried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I could n't make out what his racket was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 'd thought him a pimp or procurer but he did n't seem to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his self-effacing manner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I never could find out what his business was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He always seemed to have money in his pocket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now and then he would disappear for several days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Connections '' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Oh he 's just an international spy '' , Eileen would shout with her screechy laugh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Poor devil he can n't have been too happy either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He got no relief from drink because , though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening , he 'd leave it on the table untouched .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Occasionally if I pushed him too far he 'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Some day '' , I told Eileen , `` that guy will kill us both '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She just would n't listen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Getting drunk every night was the only way I could handle the situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Eileen seemed to feel the same way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We still had that much in common .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The trouble was drinking cost money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The way Eileen and I were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left over from my respectable uptown life , but when that was gone I did n't have a cent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I do n't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer had n't come to town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he did n't have Jim 's poker-faced humor or his brains or his charm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was a big thick beefy violent man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plug-ugly , but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little sister .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Whom God hath joined '' etcetera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The O'Dwyers were real religious people except for Kate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pat had been worried as hell ever since she 'd lost her job on that fashion magazine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It had gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art and Apparel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How about me trying to help her get her job back ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It just about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` But brother I can n't take a job right now '' , she said with her eyes on her ice cream , `` I'm going to have a baby , Francis Xavier 's baby , my own husband 's baby '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My first thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we 'd been living together six weeks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Greatest thing that ever happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and obey , and she 'd have to quit drinking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He 'd come East for the christening , by God he would .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into Eileen 's hand to help towards a layette .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pat had contacts all over the labor movement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A friend of Pat 's named Frank Sposato had just muscled into the Portwatchers ' Union .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most of them were elderly men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were n't as well paid as they should have been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sposato needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the Redhook local .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker who 'd never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For once radicalism was a recommendation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sposato could n't wait to get me hired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The things a man will do for a woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No matter how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord 's servants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church - his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career - but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , indefatigable force for good in the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He sighed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In any event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hino was elated at the prospect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor - an excellent place to make contact with the enemy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was to get involved in no arguments ; he was to try to make no converts ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage agent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job - his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand - he had been ready to become a Christian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had already been studying the Bible ; he knew the fundamentals , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rector had never been able to find out much about Hino 's past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without exception Hino 's brothers turned to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had gone into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two battles - he never went into detail regarding his military experience - and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out of the blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rector was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector 's office rarely rang unless it was important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was surprised to find Kayabashi 's secretary on the other end of the line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rector said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I guess it will be all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` This afternoon '' , the secretary said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` All right '' , Rector said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I will be expecting them '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was about to hang up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary 's voice left the conversation open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had something more to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rector laughed despite himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Unless the oyabun has been working on it '' , he said , then checked himself and added : `` You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Arigato gosaimasu '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector 's hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A good initial impression would be important now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He went into the print shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How many pamphlets do we have in stock '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rector said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I should say about a hundred thousand '' , Fletcher said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Why '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon '' , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rector 's next stop was at the schoolroom , where Mavis was monitoring a test .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He told her of the visitors and then of his plans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How many children do you have present today '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She looked back toward the schoolroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Fifteen '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , only fourteen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The little Ito girl had to go home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She has a pretty bad cold '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I want to create the impression of a compound full of children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do you think you can manage it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mavis smiled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll try '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits , but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I think I 've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for a long time '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I 've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Fine '' , Rector said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked out over the expanse of the compound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Have you ever operated a transit '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , sir '' , Johnson said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You are about to become a first-class surveyor '' , Rector said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` When Konishi gets back with the jeep , I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Konishi can help you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 'll find an old transit in the basement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The glass is out of it , but that won't matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It looks pretty efficient and that 's the important thing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He went on to explain what he had in mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Johnson nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He said he could do it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was rather a childish game , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He was not going to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission , he was going to be in for a surprise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall , and then to take charge of the office while the party was here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When everything had been done , Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi 's party .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Rector , attired in his best blue serge suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The air was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fish took the bait .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but - joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She wrote again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She could act and she could write .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal :
Have you any objection to the following plan ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She concluded by asking for a brief interview - `` to settle with you where '' - and she threw in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She opened his reply with trembling fingers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He agreed !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he would see her that evening .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Victory at last !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">At their meeting he told her not to bother about `` where '' - he would attend to that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She sang him Scott 's charming ballad `` Rosabelle '' , which was the vogue of the moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She had never sung better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Your voice is delightful '' , he approved with a warm smile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Tomorrow will be a new experience - I have never before made love to a nightingale .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There have been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy eagle - whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And so they went , he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham Abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire Club .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods , which he had had at firsthand from old Bud Dodington , one of the leaders of the so-called `` Order '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alas , all that belonged to the age of `` Devil Dashwood '' and `` Wicked Wilkes '' , abbot and beadsman of the Order !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The casual seduction of a seventeen year old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Charming and peaceful - but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alone with the fabulous Byron !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How was she to behave , Claire wondered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To be passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare 's poem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mystery - that was the thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the bedroom she would insist on darkness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With his club foot he might well be grateful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the inn , which was situated close to a broad weir , Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as `` milord '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fire in the sitting room was lighted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What about the bedroom '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Byron inquired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but I promise you you 'll never have trouble of that sort again '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So , not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Napoleon 's ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Sex is overpriced '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman 's body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So do n't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The gods seemed to think sex pretty important '' , she rebutted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Mars and Venus , Bacchus and Ariadne , Jupiter and Io , Byron and the nymph of the owl 's nest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That would be Minerva , I suppose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was n't the owl her symbol '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Byron laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` So you know something of the classics , do you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll tell you nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I do n't ask you who ' tis you 're being unfaithful to , husband or lover .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Frankly , I do n't care '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` Very well '' , she said , `` I 'll not catechize you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What matter the others so long as I have my place in history '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was striking the right note .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , flattery could hardly seem overdone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Brains and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual worlds , athlete , fabled lover - if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The light supper over , Claire went to him and , slipping an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her lips , moist and parted , spoke his name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Byron '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown ; then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bodice beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire was aflame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He drank slowly with due appreciation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was an excellent vintage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He rose and went to the bedroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pausing in the doorway he said : `` The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging loveliness in all nature '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron 's mistress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By odd coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet 's successes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As he declaimed the sonorous measures , it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Although it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said Shelley as he closed the book , `` it is still poetry of a high order '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` If he would only leave the East '' , said Mary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I am tired of sultans and scimitars '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte '' , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` How do you know that '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">demanded Mary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I was told it on good authority '' , Claire answered darkly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I must n't tell , I must n't tell '' , she repeated to herself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I promised him I would n't '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Winter came , and with it Mary 's baby - a boy as she had wished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at once Shelley 's pensioner and his most bitter detractor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter :
`` Fanny and Mrs. Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and that her child is well '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the same time another child - this one of Shelley 's brain - was given to the world : Alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind 's musings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shelley sent a copy to Southey , a former friend , and another to Godwin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Neither acknowledged the gift .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only Mary 's praise sustained him in his disappointment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She understood completely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You have made the labor worth while '' , he said to her , smiling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And in the future , since I write for a public of one , I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` A public of one '' , Mary echoed reprovingly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` how can you say such a thing ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are some even now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What about that dear , clever Mr. Thynne ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am sure he is in raptures '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Poor Mr. Thynne , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There are other Mr. Thynnes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not everyone is bewitched by Byron 's caliphs and harem beauties '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Mary 's super critical attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley 's failure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege of Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley 's generosity rebelled at .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The lordly poet was at low-water mark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On all sides doors were being slammed in his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Byron , since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor , claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel 's belt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Beckworth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Sir ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- The last six months , sir ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- You heard me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There 's a lot of waste going on here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's got to stop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I want to take a look .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is no damned holiday , Beckworth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Get busy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Yes , sir .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beckworth left the tent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He glanced back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs , methodically tearing at his thumbnail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bombproof was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the outside , it seemed no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The place smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson 's boots .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the corner was the soldier with the white flag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson hardly looked at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandishing the flag of truce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the boat had touched , the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The officer had told him that both lists must be checked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The officer , surprised , said he would have to see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had peered through the darkness at the rampart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Watson glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- We won't be too long .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If my pass is approved , I may be a half hour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The soldier answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson turned away and did not see the man 's knees buckle and his body sag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Yes , sir .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had acknowledged the man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was easier to think now , Watson decided .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He paced slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He tried to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he groped blindly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His lack of success steadily eroded his interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , seeped through him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What in the name of God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why had he crossed the dark water , to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hillman had written it all out , had n't he ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was n't the report official enough ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What did he hope to accomplish here ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Prompted by a guilty urge , he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For what ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To tell John something he would find out for himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The figure in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson snorted and then laughed aloud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Exactly !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The soldier 's voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He clutched the staff , and his dark eyes blinked apologetically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- ' Scuse me , sir .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Let 's get out of here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To his left , the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A soldier held the end of a frayed rope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three Union guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Watson stared at them curiously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were stocky men , well fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Behind them shambled a long column of weak , tattered men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The thin gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness , elbowing and shoving .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Four men were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy , indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The crawling men tried to rise and fell again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one moved to them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The third crawling man forced himself erect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He swayed like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He paced forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His steps were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a supercilious strut .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamping the craft .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Watson looked for the fourth man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had reached the three passive guards ; he crept in an incertain manner , patting the ground before him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The guards did not look at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he began to crawl again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson watched the creeping figure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He felt a spectator interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Would the man make it or not ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Say three minutes to make it sporting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow scrambling man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The figure halted , and Watson gasped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man began to creep in the wrong direction , deceived by a slight rise in the ground !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson raced for him , his boots slamming the soft earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The guards came to life with astonishing menace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They spun and flung their rifles up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson gesticulated wildly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One man dropped to his knee for better aim .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- Let me help him , for the love of God !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He reached down and closed his fingers on the man 's upper arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson stared into a cadaverous face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Light sticks of fingers , the tips gummy with dark earth , patted at Watson 's throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The man 's voice was a sweet , patient whisper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">- Henry said that he 'd take my arm and get me right there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But you ai n't Henry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- It do n't matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is it far ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">How far could it be , Watson thought bleakly , how far can a blind man crawl ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another body length or all the rest of his nighted life ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Not far .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- You talk deep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not like us fellas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It raises the voice , bein in camp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You Secesh ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Come on , now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Can you walk ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Why , course I can .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I can walk real good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Watson stumbled down the bank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man leaned his frail body against Watson 's shoulder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was no heavier than a child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson paused for breath .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson 's neck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His sweet whisper came after great effort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Oh , Christ .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I wish you was Henry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He promised to take me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Hush .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We 're almost there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson turned away , sickened for the first time in many months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He heard the patient voice calling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Henry ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where are you , Henry ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- Make him lie down !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson snatched a deep breath .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had not meant to shout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stood with his back to the skiff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The men mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Goddamn you !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What do you do to them ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was angry , sickened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had not felt that during the afternoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No , nor later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All his emotions had been inward , self-conscious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In war , on a night like this , it was only the outward emotions that mattered , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was sure of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John 's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What a fool he had been to think of his brother !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So Charles was dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What did it matter ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His name had been crossed off a list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Already his cool body lay in the ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What words had any meaning ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What had he thought of , to go to John , grovel and beg understanding ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Men were slaughtered every day , tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What made him think John had a right to witness his brother 's humiliation ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What right had John to any special consideration ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Was John better , more deserving ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To hell with John .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let him chafe with impatience to see Charles , rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman 's beautiful , schoolmaster 's hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John would curse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He believed that brave boys did n't cry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watson spat on the ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was grimly satisfied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother 's pain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , `` O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As I say , I would n't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I can see it from this window where I write .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It bulks under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and I think Mrs. Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would have been like her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was a pale woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sitting on her terrace , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an axe of self-esteem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Offer her a cup of tea and she would say , `` Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Show her the new swimming pool and she would say , slapping her ankle , `` I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hand her a chair and she would say , `` Why , it 's a nice imitation of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These trumps were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Twenty years ago , she would have been known as a golf widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She usually wore weeds , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr. Pastern was dead , but Mr. Pastern was far from dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was marching up and down the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting , `` Bomb Cuba !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bomb Berlin !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let 's throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was brigadier of the club 's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It all began on an autumn afternoon - and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year 's lights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs. Pastern stopped to admire the October light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Balcolm worked for the brain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Ten Eyke did mental health .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Trenchard worked for the blind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs. Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs. Craven was cancer , and Mrs. Gilkson did the kidney .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league , Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was her destiny ; it was her life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her mother had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">The contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She stopped at the Surcliffes ' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund '' , she said excitedly when he walked in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning - would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But I do n't know the Flannagans '' , Charlie Pastern said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He was tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins ' , thinking that they might give him a drink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the Blevins were away ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Turning in at the Flannagans ' driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was a glass pane in the front door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Infectious hepatitis '' , he shouted heartily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , please come in '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The girlish voice was nearly a whisper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was not a girl , he could see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Your wife just called '' , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` And I am not sure that I have any cash - any money , that is - but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wo n't you step into the living room , where it 's cozier '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where was Mr. Flannagan , he wondered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Travelling home on a late train ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Changing his clothes upstairs ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Taking a shower ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everything 's on the table '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What train does Mr. Flannagan come out on '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mr. Flannagan is away '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her voice dropped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mr. Flannagan has been away for six weeks '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll have a drink , then , if you 'll have one with me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` If you will promise to make it weak '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Sit down '' , he said , `` and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The only way to find things is to relax '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All in all , they had six drinks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He travelled all over the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She did n't like to travel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Planes made her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She and her husband had formerly lived in New York , where she had many friends , but Mr. Flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She had no children ; she had made no friends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I 've seen you , though , before '' , she said with enormous coyness , patting his knee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sheer plumpness , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And knowing its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he did n't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I 've never done this before '' , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her voice shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did n't doubt her truthfulness , although he had heard the words a hundred times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , putting on their stockings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On ships at sea , on railroad trains , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , `` I 've never done this before '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where have you been '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mrs. Pastern asked sadly , when he came in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's after eleven '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I had a drink with the Flannagans '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She told me he was in Germany '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He came home unexpectedly '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Bomb them '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he shouted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Throw a little nuclear hardware at them !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Show them who 's boss '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But in bed he had trouble sleeping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He loved them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His money was tied up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maple and ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then , getting back into bed , he thought unashamedly of Mrs. Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are , he thought , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a little crude ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil ; that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives ( two marriages , two births , one divorce ) , Christmas and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her thoughts were not discrete .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Please come down as soon as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters stalked from the broad nibbed pen , `` I have an important matter to discuss with you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To Abel :
`` I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You may stay as long as you wish , of course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Mark : `` Please give my regards to Myra '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` My nephews will be coming down '' , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room , the whole meal on a vast linen covered tray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking at the water , something of the light of the sea in them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That will be so nice for you , Mrs. Packard '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Um '' , said the old lady , and brought her eyes down to the tray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You remember them , I suppose '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She glinted suspiciously at the dish before her : `` Blowfish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I hope Raphael bought them whole '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Angelina stepped back , her eyes roaming the tray for omissions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then she looked at the old woman again , her eyes calm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes '' , she said , `` I remember that they came here every summer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I used to play with the older one sometimes , when he 'd let me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Abel '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She would have said triumph .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jessica Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped for her fork .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Procreation , expansion , proliferation - these are the laws of living things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments : oblivion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was the last living of the older generation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What had once been a widespread family - at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county - had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">What hope lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She ate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table 's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here , too , she talked low , quirking her head at one or another of the places , most often at Izaak 's armchair which faced her across the long table .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed , consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She thought again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The girl , her first , she barely remembered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It could have been anyone 's infant , for it had not survived the bassinet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the boy , the boy had been alive yesterday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The brothers drove down together in Mark 's small red sports car , Mark at the wheel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They rarely spoke .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw the land with a stranger 's eyes , all the old familiarness gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was stability there , too - a color which his life had had once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is what childhood is , he told himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Solid , settled , lost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica 's letter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The boyhood summers preceding their uncle 's funeral might never have been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak 's grave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The small car flew on relentlessly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The old woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Abel moved and adjusted his long legs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he 'd make in the years to come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She did n't mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She 's probably getting old - crotchety , I mean - and we figured uh-uh , better not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They 've never met , you know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Myra would n't budge without an express invitation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I feel kind of bad about it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I imagine the old girl has n't missed us much '' , Mark added , his eyes on the road .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Abel ignored the half expressed bid for confirmation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He smiled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was barely possible that his brother was right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He could tell they were approaching the sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The air took on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin wife as the last century ended .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Remember the Starbird ? ''</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The Starbird , '' Abel said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">All of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They came unexpectedly upon the sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they 'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oh he 'd not care about the Pedersen kid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That would make him mad enough if he was sober .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I did n't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was all shoveled up like I thought he 'd be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think his name stopped the snoring but he did n't move except to roll a little when I shoved him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall - there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster - and I thought , Well you do n't look much like a pig-drunk bully now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I could n't be sure he was still asleep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was a cagey sonofabitch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I shook him a little harder and made some noise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Pap-pap-pap-hey '' , I said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was leaning too far over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I knew better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oh he was smart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It put you off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck , watering my eyes , and I backed off to cough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pa was on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Get the hell out of here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I did n't say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was better , though , he 'd hit me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was bitter when he missed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Get the hell out of here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Big Hans sent me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He told me to wake you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` A fat hell on Big Hans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Get out of here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He found the Pedersen kid by the crib '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Get the hell out '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pa pulled at the covers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was tasting his mouth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The kid 's froze good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hans is rubbing him with snow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's got him in the kitchen '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Pedersen '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , Pa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's the Pedersen kid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The kid '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Nothing to steal from the crib '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not stealing , Pa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was just lying there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hans found him froze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's where he was when Hans found him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pa laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I ai n't hid nothing in the crib '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You do n't understand , Pa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Pedersen kid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The kid '' -
`` I god damn well understand '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pa had his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he 'd grown a mustache once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I god damn well understand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You know I do n't want to see Pedersen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That cock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why should I ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What did he come for , hey ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">God dammit , get .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And do n't come back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Find out something .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 're a fool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Both you and Hans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pedersen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That cock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do n't come back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Out '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had long black hairs on his wrist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Big Hans made me come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Big Hans said '' -
`` A fat hell on Big Hans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He 's an even bigger fool than you are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fat , hey ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I taught him , dammit , and I 'll teach you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You want me to drop my pot '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was about to get up so I got out , slamming the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he threw things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pa 'd been shit sick in that pot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hans got an axe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did n't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa 's door down before he stopped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He might not have gone that far if Pa had n't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was rubbing snow on the kid 's legs and feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking to the kid 's back and behind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ai n't he going to wake up '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What about your pa '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He was awake when I left '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What 'd he say ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did you get the whisky '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't be smart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did you ask him about the whisky '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't be smart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What 's he going to do '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Go back to sleep most likely '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 'd best get that whisky '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Take the axe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pa 's scared to hell of axes '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Listen to me , Jorge , I 've had enough to your sassing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This kid 's froze bad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If I do n't get some whisky down him he might die .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You want the kid to die ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well , get your pa and get that whisky '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Pa do n't care about the kid '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Jorge '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well he do n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He do n't care at all , and I do n't care to get my head busted neither .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He do n't care , and I do n't care to have his shit flung on me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He do n't care about anybody .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Get pig-drunk - that 's what he wants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He do n't care about nothing else at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not Pedersen 's kid neither .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That cock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not the kid neither '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll get the spirits '' , Ma said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 'd wound Big Hans up tight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was ready to jump but when Ma said she 'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not any more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not for years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he 'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa 's yellow sick insides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` No you won't '' , Big Hans said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , Hans , if they 're needed '' , Ma said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hans rubbed the kid with more snow & & & rubbed & & & rubbed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll get more snow '' , I said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I do n't know where Ma went .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I thought she 'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she 'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was awful angry because he 'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I know him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I know him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We felt the same sometimes , while Ma was n't thinking about that at all , not anything like that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no way of getting even .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was n't like getting cheated at the fair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were always trying so you got to expect it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now Hans had given Ma something of his - we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa - something valuable ; but since she did n't know we 'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she 'd done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ma had found one of Pa 's hiding places .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She 'd found one and she had n't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pa had a knack for hiding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But now Ma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She 'd found it by luck most likely but she had n't said anything and we did n't know how long ago it 'd been or how many other ones she 'd found , saying nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pa was sure to find out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes he did n't seem to because he hid them so well he could n't find them himself or because he looked and did n't find anything and figured he had n't hid one after all or had drunk it up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he 'd find out about this one because we were using it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A fool could see what was going on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he found out Ma found it - that 'd be bad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He took pride in his hiding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was all the pride he had .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I guess fooling Hans and me took doing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he did n't figure Ma for much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did n't figure her at all , and if he found out * * h a woman * * h it 'd be bad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hans poured some in a tumbler .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You going to put more towels on him '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why not ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That 's what he needs , something warm to his skin , do n't he '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Not where he 's froze good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Heat 's bad for frostbite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's why I only put towels on his chest and belly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's got to thaw slow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You ought to know that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Colors on the towels had run .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ma poked her toe in the kid 's clothes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What are we going to do with these '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid 's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Here , help me prop him up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I got hold his mouth open '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I did n't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid 's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and did n't make any move to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Come on , Jorge '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` All right '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Lift , do n't shove * * h lift '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` O.K. , I'm lifting '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I took him by the shoulders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His head flopped back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His mouth fell open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The skin on his neck was tight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was cold all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hold his head up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 'll choke '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` His mouth is open '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` His throat 's shut .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 'll choke '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 'll choke anyway '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hold his head up '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I can n't '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't hold him like that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Put your arms around him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well Jesus '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was cold all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I put my arm carefully around him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hans had his fingers in the kid 's mouth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now he 'll choke for sure '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Shut up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Just hold him like I told you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was cold all right , and wet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I had my arm behind his back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was in his mid fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down front of his house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It all seemed - if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows - as though this broken nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he was not bored at all ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are , after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He left his home the day after New Year 's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife Cleota 's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he was too busy to hear what she was saying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So they parted when she was in an impatient humor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , `` Defrost the refrigerator '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would settle himself into his seat to laugh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really did n't have to , mad at their both got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed , brushed , and taking breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Now drive carefully , for God's sake '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">she called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying `` Toot-toot '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">to the stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; improvise cha-chas on the harp ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She fell asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then she fell asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But yes , nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She stood still over the leg of lamb , rubbing herbs into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that started her shivering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But they all said , `` No , your time will come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Enjoy being a bride while you can '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House ( where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without saying so , she was really grateful ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe 's wife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">People died , she would have said , in hospitals , or in cars on the highway at night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bobby Joe was gone all day now , not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When they first married he had been working in the fields all day , and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now there was no work in the fields , nor would there be till it rained , and she did not know where he went .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not that she complained , or had any cause to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Four or five of the cousins from East Texas were about his age , so naturally they ran around together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no reason for her to ask what they did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus a new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny Albright did not die .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She lay still on the bed , her head hardly denting the pillow ; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around , and sometimes she took a little milk or soup .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They stopped expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home , for she might die any time ; but they might as well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So the pattern was established .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs , she would go to the Big House .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bobby Joe and the boys would come by , say `` How 's Granny '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">and sit on the porch a while .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The older men would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The women and children stayed at the Albrights ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The women , keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room , sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The children had to play away from the house ( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper quietness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Off and on , all day , someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The evaporative cooler had been moved to Granny 's room , and her door was kept shut ; so that the rest of the house stayed open , though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The dust clogged their throats , and the heat parched them , so that the women were always making ice water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty pound blocks of ice in town , as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One afternoon , as the women sat clucking softly , a new carload of people pulled up at the gate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a Cadillac , black grayed with the dust of the road , its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were an old fat couple ( as Linda Kay described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was much embracing , much exclaiming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Cousin Ada !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cousin John '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Cousin Lura '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Cousin Howard '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And how is she '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` About the same , John , about the same '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All the women got up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming , `` and the news did n't catch up with us till we were nearly home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We came on as soon as we could '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was the suggestion of ice water , and - in spite of the protest `` We 're not really thirsty '' - Linda Kay , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices , hurried to the kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She filled a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Carrying it to the living room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and roundly slim , a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain , at such a time , in such a place , and she tossed back her long yellow hair , smiling shyly as she entered the room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Howard ( the thick middle-aged man ) was looking at her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She felt the look and looked back because she could not help it , seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` And who is this '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked , when she passed him a glass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh that 's Linda Kay '' , Mama Albright said fondly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` She married our baby boy , Bobby Joe , this summer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Let 's see '' , Cousin Ada said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` He 's a right smart younger than the rest '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh yes '' , Mama laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 's ten years younger than Ernest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We did n't expect him to come along ; thought for the longest he was a tumor '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This joke was not funny to Linda Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; then , hearing the muffled boom of Howard 's laughter , blushed redder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Who is Howard , anyway '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she asked Bobby Joe that night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He makes me uncomfortable '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh he 's a second cousin or something .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He got in the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some money '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How old is he '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Gosh , I do n't know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thirty-five , I guess .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's been married and got this half grown kid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If he bothers you , do n't pay him any mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He 's just a big windbag '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bobby Joe was thinking about something else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Say , did you know they 're fixing to have a two day antelope season on the Double X '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was talking about antelope again when they woke up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Listen , I never had a chance to kill an antelope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There never was a season before , but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Did he ever visit here when he was a kid '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Linda Kay asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Who '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Howard '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hell , I do n't know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When he was a kid I was n't around '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` Bye now '' was gone for the day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in the Cadillac .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 're going after ice '' , Howard said , `` and thought maybe you 'd go along and keep us company '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was really no reason to refuse , and Linda Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was such a well-rounded teenager , having been a twirler , Future Farmers sweetheart , and secretary of Future Homemakers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In her sophomore year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe , who was a football player , Future Homemakers sweetheart , and president of Future Farmers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was easy to see that they were made for each other , and they knew what they wanted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bobby Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But there was no need for Linda Kay to go on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and ( blushing ) raise his children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Howard sighed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You lucky kids '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'd give anything if I could have found a girl like you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then he told Linda Kay about himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course he could n't say much , really , because of Debora , but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It made her feel different about Howard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been , but he brought one of the cousins home for supper , and all they did was talk about antelope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Cook a whole antelope '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">she exclaimed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Why , I could n't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; I never even saw any '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , you could .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I want to roast the whole thing , and have it for the boys '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Linda Kay told him he could n't do anything like that with his Grandma dying , and he said well they had to eat , did n't they , they were n't all dying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Linda Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry ; but they were going up to the Big House after supper , and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every night they all went to Mama and Papa Albright 's , and sat on the open front porch , where they could get the breeze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was full-of-the-moon ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They all sat around and drank ice water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once in a while they said what a shame it was , with Granny dying , but they all agreed she would n't have wanted it any other way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That night the older men got to talking about going possum hunting on a moonlight night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum hunting , and Uncle Bill Farnworth ( from Mama Albright 's side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After they had left , some of the people moved around , to find more comfortable places to sit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There were not many chairs , so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch , resting their feet on the ground , and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Howard , who had been sitting against the wall , said he needed more fresh air , and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You 'll be a darn sight more comfortable there , Howard '' , Ernest said , laughing , and they all laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bobby Joe had been sitting close to her , touching her actually , and holding her hand from time to time , but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; but she had never been so aware of anyone 's flesh before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still she was not sorry he sat by her , but in fact was flattered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person ; he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alex asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor retorted , confirming Alex 's anticipations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What I want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate Alex further into these undertakings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex 's inspection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens ' eggs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands , thoroughly eared and big as a table top .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He placed it on Alex 's lap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` This is my hen ledger '' , he informed him in an absorbed way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's been going since 1908 when I was a junior in college .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That first entry there is the Vermont Flumenophobe , the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties - great big scapulars and hardly any primaries at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Could n't take them near a river , though , or they 'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before Thanksgiving '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The ledger was full of most precise information :
date of laying , length of incubation period , number of chicks reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster 's wattles and so on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Below these particulars was a series of alpha beta gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alex 's instruction was rapid , for the doctor had to go off to the Rue Ecole de Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But after the doctor 's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A knocking at Alex 's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The market was not far and , once there , the doctor 's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks , he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention , he quacked with the ducks , and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a fine broody hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex 's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and wattles , the length and quality of neck and saddle hackles , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All search was ended ; he had found his fowl .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set up , nestling in the doctor 's arms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance ; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex 's well exercised breast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The doctor was wearing a long New England greatcoat , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up , with gingerly steps , towards the first landing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was then that they heard the tread of one descending and , in some perturbation glancing up , saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Bonjour , messieurs , vous etes matinals '' , she greeted them pleasantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him , attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind Alex 's arm and back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">their hostess enquired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts , trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The doctor , he noticed , was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Eyes swerved in the patronne 's head , Alex coughed loudly , and the doctor , with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him , took to the stairs in long shanked leaps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Comment '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">ejaculated the surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , parting from her without ceremony , only offered a few words about the doctor 's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With that he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Alex entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the hen 's attentions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no reference to the incident on the stairs , his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One part of her audience was totally engaged , the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote ; the audience attended .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Startled , he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went to the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling , coughing , and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was Giselle , the fille de chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Who was that , young feller '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the doctor instantly asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That was the fille de chambre , the one you thought could n't get the eggs out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She looked mighty interested , though .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anyhow she 's coming back in five minutes to do the room '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The doctor 's mind was working at a great speed ; he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Have you got our keys handy '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Right in my pocket '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` All right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now you go outside and beckon me when it 's safe '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The hall was empty and Alex beckoned ; they climbed the stairs which creaked , very loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A guest was locking his room ; they passed behind him and got to Alex 's room unnoticed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">The doctor sat down rather wearily , caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry loving man , but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor 's room and the time she began Alex 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe ; the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre 's presence inside ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although a look of alarm passed over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; unwarranted they were in any case for , as he stood facing the fille de chambre , his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The events of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard , had overcome the doctor 's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails , perhaps mourning her nest , but briefly enjoyed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The doctor 's wits had not left him , however , for all his sixty-eight years , and the wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out from the showerhead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor 's room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Shortly , the doctor himself entered , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Next , the hen was nested and all seemed well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The two men sat for some time , savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings , before they got up and left the hotel , the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to go to the main post office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alex returned to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an ebullient mood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Chickens have short memories '' , the doctor remarked , `` that 's why they are better company than most people I know '' , and he went on to break some important news to Alex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They 've got a big vulture from Tanganika at the zoo here , with a wife for him , too , very rare birds , both of them , the only Vulturidae of their species outside Africa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Seems like she 's willing , but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the barn and then did n't know what to do , and the people at the zoo have n't got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Going downstairs with the tray , Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little girl look .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There were times it was n't right to make a person happy , like the times she came in the kitchen and asked for a peanut butter sandwich .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You know we do n't keep peanut butter in this house '' , he always told her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Why , Winston '' , she 'd cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the jar '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the kitchen , Leona , his little young wife , was reading the morning paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Here '' , Winston said gently , `` what 's these dishes doing not washed '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The enormous plates which had held Mr. Jack 's four fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Leave me alone '' , Leona said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ca n't you see I'm busy '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` This is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and I bet you left things every which way upstairs , your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Leona '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His eye had fastened on her leg ; bending , he touched her knee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` If I catch you one more time down here without stockings '' -
She twitched her leg away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Fuss , fuss , old man '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She had an alley cat 's manners .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston stacked Miss Ada 's thin pink dishes in the sink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he spread out the last list on the counter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` To Be Left Behind '' was printed at the top in Miss Ada ; fine hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Winston took out a pencil , admired the point , and wrote slowly and heavily , `` Clothes Stand '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sighing , Leona dropped the paper and stood up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I guess I better get ready to go '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Carefully , he undid the bow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How come your bows is always cockeyed '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She turned and put her arms around his neck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't want to leave here , Winston '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now listen to that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He drew back , embarrassed and pleased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I thought you was sick to death of this big house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Said you wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` At least there is room here '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I told you what Miss Ada 's doctor said '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't mean Miss Ada !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What you think I care about that ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I mean our children '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She sounded as though they already existed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In spite of the hundred things he had on his mind , Winston went and put his arm around her waist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 've got plenty of time to think about that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All the time in the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We 've only been married four years , January '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Four years '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she wailed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's a long time , waiting '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` How many times have I told you '' - he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off - `` Too many times '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- and flounced to the sink , where she began noisily to wash her hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Too many times was the truth of it , Winston thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He hardly believed his reason himself any more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although it had seemed a good reason , to begin with : no couple could afford to have children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` How you going to work with a child hanging on you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked Leona .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You want to keep this job , do n't you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He doubted whether she heard him , over the running water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sat for a while with his hands on his knees , watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things - a comb , a bottle of aspirin - to take upstairs and pack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She made him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; it was something to do with her back , the thinness of it , and the quick , jerky way she bent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was too young , that was all ; too young and thin and straight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Winston '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was Mr. Jack , bellowing out in the hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston hurried through the swinging door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr. Jack complained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was standing in front of the mirror , tightening his tie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know what you think you 've been doing about my clothes '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` This coat looks like a rag heap '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He gave Mr. Jack a real going over ; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm strokes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hey '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Winston enjoyed seeing him start out ; he wore his clothes with style .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he was going to town , nothing was good enough - he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At home , he would n't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The velvet smoking jackets , pearl gray , wine , and blue , which Miss Ada had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Good-by , Winston '' , Mr. Jack said , giving a final set to his hat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Look out for those movers '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; a handsome , fine-looking man it made him proud to see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After Mr. Jack drove away , Winston went on looking out the window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Then he looked at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up , slit , and open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the first time , he let himself be sad about the move .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That house was ten years off his life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward , and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He knew the house like a blind man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ten years ago , he had come to the house to be interviewed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Miss Ada had been out back , in a straw hat , planting flowers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had talked to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which made him sweat and feel ashamed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Winston had been surprised at her for that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress - citron yellow , if he remembered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had had a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since then , the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkles were coming on , blue by the porch steps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a week the hyacinths would spike out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the dogwood in early May , for Miss Ada 's alfresco party ; and after that the Japanese cherries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now the yard looked wet and bald , the trees bare under their buds , but in a while Miss Ada 's flowers would bloom like a marching parade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a tag with her writing on it ; where would she go for her gardening now ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Somehow Winston did n't think she 'd take to window boxes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sighing , he hurried to the living room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had a thousand things to see to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , he could n't help thinking , we 're all getting old , getting small ; the snail is pulling in her horns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the living room , Miss Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was looking out at the garden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Winston '' , she said , `` get the basket for the breakables '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He brought it in and put it down beside her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Miss Ada was looking fine ; she had on her Easter suit , blue , with lavender binding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Halfway across the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It hung in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Frowning , Miss Ada studied the list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , let 's see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The china lemon tree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The alabaster cockatoo '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston followed her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrapping them in tissue paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Neither of them trusted the movers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When they came to Mr. Jack 's photograph , twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame , Miss Ada said , `` By rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won n't take my clotheshorse '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She smiled at Winston , and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He picked up the photograph and began to wrap it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` At least you could leave it for the movers '' , Miss Ada said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Winston folded the tissue paper carefully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 's used it every day ; every morning , I lay out his clothes on it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , that 's over now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And it was his main present !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leave that fool picture out '' , she added sharply .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston laid it in the basket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mr. Jack sets store by that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Really , Winston .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was meant to be my present '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But she went on down the list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston was relieved ; those presents had been on his mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You know what she likes , Winston '' , he had said wearily , one evening in November when Winston was pulling off his overshoes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tell me what to get her for Christmas '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She 's been talking about a picture '' , Winston had told him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Picture !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You mean picture of me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Winston had persuaded him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On Christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Through the door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Finally she had come down ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How do you like it '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she had asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Is that a compliment '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had stood at a little distance , studying her , as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Lovie , you make me feel naked '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Miss Ada had giggled , and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr. Jack had started .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Not a line , not a wrinkle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I look like an old man , compared '' , and he had picked up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Look , an old man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Will you wear pink when you 're sixty '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Darling , I love that photograph .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm going to put it on my dresser '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I guess it 's children make a woman old .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A man gets old anyhow '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After a minute he went on , `` People must think the curse is on me , seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'll give you a medical certificate , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada had said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All I want is a picture - with a few lines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Make the man put them in if he has to '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Miss Ada had stood up , rustling and rustling , and gone upstairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Was it love ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I had no doubt that it was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation and delight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In final separation from them , in the railroad terminal across the river from New York , I would nearly cry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These letters became the center of my existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after school class I was enrolled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle - it must have been late in September - I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and bloody , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The weeks went by , and the longer our separation grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As it turned out , Jessica took matters into her own hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Having received permission to give a camp reunion Halloween party , she asked that I come and be her date .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I went and , mum and nervous , all but made a fool of myself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates , I was shy with Jessie and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom , later , in the privacy of our bunks , we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I remember standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft drinks to her guests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was wearing her dark hair in two , thick braids to attain an `` American Girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was late , we were playing kissing games , and Jessica and I called on to kiss in front of the others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We blushed and were flustered , and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting premonitions of lust , all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was at that party that , finally overcoming my timidity , inspired by tales only half understood and overheard among older boys , I asked Jessie to spend New Year's Eve with me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lovingly , she accepted , and so great was my emotion that all I could think of saying was , `` You 're amazing , you know '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Later , we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We would write to one another and make a definite plan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was terribly pleased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Among my school and neighborhood friends , during the next months , I bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But though I boasted and gave off a dapper front , I was beneath it all frightened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl , or how one behaved :
Should I hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should I bring along a corsage or send one to her ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Should I accompany her to the door of her home , or should I ask to be invited in ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In or out , should I kiss her good-night ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All this was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When in one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New Year's Eve , I knew for a moment an immense relief ; but the letter went on : she had cried , she had implored , she had been miserable at his refusal , and finally he had relented - and now how happy she was , how expectant !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her optimism gave me heart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I forced confidence into myself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I made inquiries , I read a book of etiquette .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In December I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel Astor , a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We would attend a film and , later on , I stated , we might go to the Mayflower Coffee Shop or Child 's or Toffenetti 's for waffles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I set the hour of our meeting for seven .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At five o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil 's ears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My camp made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitches around the edges , I stuffed with money I had been saving .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hatless , in an overcoat of rough blue wool , I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father , and I set out into the strangely still streets of Brooklyn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind , felt older than my years , and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of Manhattan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Times Square , when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming with celebrants , with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Heavy coated , severe looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The night was cold but the crowd kept one warm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cardboard noisemakers , substitutes for the unavailable tin models , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway , and one 's ears were continually serenaded by the horns ' rasps and bleats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An old gentlemen next to me held a Boy Scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted out , `` V for Victory '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His neighbors cheered him on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a great sense of camaraderie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How did one join them ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where were they all walking to ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I looked over their faces and felt a twinge : they all looked so much more knowing than I .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I looked away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I looked for Jessica to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd and , as the time passed and I waited , a fiend came to life beside me and whispered in my ear : How was I planning to greet Jessica ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where exactly would we go after the movie ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we could n't get in ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Suppose I had n't brought along enough money ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I felt for my wallet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Its thick , substantial outline calmed me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But when I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone wrong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I grew uneasy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking place , like abrupt , jerky scenes in old silent movies , joyous greetings and beginnings , huggings and kissings , enthusiastic forays into the festive night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whole platoons were taking up new positions on the steps , arriving and departing , while I stayed glued , like a signpost , to one spot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">At 7 : 25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps , carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway , and as I watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground , their golden , fringed epaulets and spic , red visored caps , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My heart almost stopped beating .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Right '' , said the fingerprint man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Also , if you 're going to believe those prints , you 'll have to look for a killer who 's a top-grade piano player '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano , doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To make it clearer he shifted to acting out , but with no change of manner , the killing of Rose Mallory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His hands snatched at an imaginary bucket , swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like a ball that 's been bounced hard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that , pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was moving like a ballet dancer , playing for laughs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If Rose Mallory 's killer acted this way , catching up with him was going to be a cinch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We 'd know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he 'd wear twined in his hair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered woman 's apartment , we might have had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This , you will remember , was still New Year's Day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up , it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night 's noisemakers and paper hats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Felix was the exception .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had retained his hat and his horn , and , whatever fun might still be going , he was ready to join it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That , incidentally , might give you some idea of what Felix was like .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all , he had n't happened upon us in that second floor hall without warning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The ME 's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The meat wagon , therefore , was not out in front of the house any more , but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was , furthermore , the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Just put yourself in Felix 's place for a moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 're a taxpayer , householder , landlord .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 've been away from home for the New Year festivities , but now the party is over and you come home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Defining sobriety in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not yet eliminated from the system , you are sober .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You still have your paper hat and you 're wearing it , but then , it is an extraordinary paper hat and , in addition to anything else you may be , you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back yard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr. Average Citizen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You have your paper horn clutched in your big , craggy fist , and for your entrance you have planned a noisy , colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You find your house a focus of public and police attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Can you imagine yourself forgetting under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You identify yourself and ask him what 's going on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead of answering you , he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Got the upstairs guy '' , he bellows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The owner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do I send him up '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he turns back to you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Go on in '' , he says .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` They 'll tell you what 's cooking '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even then , as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable , official control , could you go on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What I'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for Felix 's being an odd one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We 'd seen his handiwork out in the back yard , and the little his tenants had told us of him did make him sound a little special .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We were not , however , prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as Felix came up the stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He , of course , must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him , but , nonetheless , I did find his reaction startling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If Felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because he 'd forgotten about them , he now remembered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He came bounding up the stairs and joined the dance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He adjusted the hat , lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a flute , and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to cavort with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Our man stopped dead and glowered at Felix .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was a bull of a man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was big chested , big-shouldered and heavy-armed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His face was ruddy and heavy and unlined , and when he laughed he showed his teeth , which were big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do n't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was almost as white as his teeth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For a man of his mass he was curiously short .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was n't a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For Felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man was just this side of being a freak .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We waited till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor man 's country weekend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dark gray sports jacket , lighter gray slacks , pink flannel shirt , black silk necktie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His eyes were clear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was freshly shaved , and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not even a whiff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eventually he subsided .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Felix '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gibby said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Me '' , he said merrily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Me , the happy one '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That much Latin we remember '' , Gibby said dryly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You always live up to your name , always like this , always making happy '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I try '' , Felix said blithely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` The world is full of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 've never noticed that it improves things any '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Bully for you '' , Gibby said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What 's the rest of your name '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No rest of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Felix is all there is '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` All there ever was '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` The past I leave to historians '' , Felix intoned , demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You live in the present '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` In the present '' , Felix proclaimed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` For the future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is there any other time in which a man can live '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We '' , Gibby announced , `` are not philosophers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We are Assistant District Attorneys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This gentleman is a police officer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is a fingerprint specialist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Could your future , your immediate future , be made to include taking us upstairs , giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work , and making available to him your finger tips '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The happy one could never have looked happier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was more than joy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was ecstasy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Those lovely whorls '' , he chortled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` So intricate , so beautiful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Come right along .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I love fingerprints '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was prancing along the hall , heading for the next flight of stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gibby called him back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 're here because of what happened last night '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Past , yes , but important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since it is important , for the record let 's have the full name '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That important '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Felix asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That important '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Grubb '' , Felix whispered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Felix Grubb '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gibby asked , not bothering to whisper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Shh '' , Felix implored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I can n't see what would make it necessary for you to know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Obligingly Gibby lowered his voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Felix Grubb '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he repeated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Edmund , but not for years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For years it 's been just Felix .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First thing I did after my twenty-first birthday was go into court and have it officially changed , and this is something I do n't tell everybody .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was almost forty years ago '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty , he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This was a broth of a boy , our Felix , and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We followed him up the stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The cops would gather up Connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You may think we did n't need Nancy and Jean , but you always get what you can when you can , and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them could n't be useful before we were through with this case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The killer , if in our present group , would certainly be interested in knowing that much , and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation , there might always be some way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you can possibly avoid it , you do n't hand out any extra chances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Felix took us into his studio .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house , where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At each angle of its pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Felix first opened the door on it , all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He quickly fixed that , rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He flew about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">None of his movements was tentative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no process of trial and error .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Starting with the room completely blacked out , as it was when we came in , he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Expecting something more-than average wacky , I was surprised by what we found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no display of either works in progress or of finished work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here and there on work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped over it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These shapes might have been mad , but there was no telling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were all completely shrouded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman 's comfort , convenience and efficiency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were tools about but they were neatly kept .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no confusion and no litter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy did not see the newspapers the next day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Someone on his staff - he suspected it was Ed Thornburg - intercepted them and for this Andy was grateful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule , a crutch he rarely used , and did n't awaken until early afternoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew also , and those who had kidnapped him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But where ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was still a very big world , despite all the modern cant to the contrary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was dozing , perhaps the only sleep he 'd gotten .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He snapped to alertness at Andy 's entrance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sorry , Mr. Paxton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nothing new .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lot of people waiting to see you , though '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Reporters '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Our own people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Questions about the show tonight '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hub picked up the telephone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Shall I let them know you 're awake '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I suppose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How 's Lissa , do you know '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hub considered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Some better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She 's got plenty of guts , Mr. Paxton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You want me to call her '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She expecting me to '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hub shook his head so Andy told him not to bother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He could not manage the former or expect the latter ; they had nothing to give to each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The omission might look peculiar to outsiders , but Andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had little time to himself , anyway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As the afternoon sped toward evening , the suite saw a steady procession of Paxton aides pass in and out , each with his own special problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thornburg arrived with the writers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had spent the morning revising the act , eliminating all the gay songs , patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified , as befitting the tragic circumstances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Raymond Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed `` Cradle Song '' in case it was needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Charlie Marble was back and forth on several occasions , first to confer with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas engagement - they decided it was wise - and later to announce that a prominent comedian , also an agency client , had agreed to fill the casino 's open date .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And once Bake slipped in , pale and drawn , last night 's liquor still on his breath with some of today 's added to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He asked if there was anything he could do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy invented a job to keep him busy , sending him ahead to El Dorado to supervise last minute arrangements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But from Rocco Vecchio , they heard nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At last it was time to depart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hub , nosing about , spotted reporters in the lobby , so Andy was hustled away quietly through the hotel 's service entrance in a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel , but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">El Dorado was surrounded by a mob .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They overflowed the parking lot , making progress by automobile difficult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Long before he reached the protection of the stage door , Andy was recognized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brush-fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They surged around him , fingers pointing , eyes prying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night 's hero-worshippers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had come not to admire but to observe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Skolman 's jammed in every table he could find .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Under the heading of it 's an ill wind , et cetera '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Backstage was tomb like by contrast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy 's co-workers kept their distance , awed by the tragedy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But in his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read , `` We 're with you all the way '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was signed by everyone in the troupe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy could n't help but be touched .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bake himself looked better ; any kind of job was better than brooding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Andy told him , `` Bake , I wish you 'd talk to Skolman , see if some kind of p. a. system can be rigged up outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper was n't able to get a table .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would n't want him to miss the message '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll try .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Skolman is n't going to like it much , though , giving away what he should be selling '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Skolman was n't the only one who did n't care for Andy 's scheme .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A short time later , Lieutenant Bonner stomped into the dressing room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I got a bone to pick with you , Mr. Paxton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It 's those damn loudspeakers '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What about them '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They 're going to louse me up good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My men have been here all afternoon , setting up for this thing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bonner explained that , with the nightclub 's cooperation , the police had occupied El Dorado like a battlefield .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Motion picture cameras had been installed to film the audience , the reservation list was being checked out name by name , and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside , even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I want you to have the speakers taken out '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy sighed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Seems like we 're never going to see eye to eye , Lieutenant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did n't they tell you what I wanted the p. a. system for '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sure , I know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it 's such a long shot '' -
`` No longer than yours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What do you expect to get tonight , anyway ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or have a sign on his car that says , ' Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper '' ' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy crumbled the script in his fist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I can n't stop you from doing what you think is right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But do n't try to stop me , either '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Someday '' , Bonner said , `` you 're going to ask us for help .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I can hardly wait '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What you do n't understand is that I'm asking for it now '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Bonner departed , still full of ill will .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination ; he had to cling to routine , tested procedures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But , admit or not , Bonner was helpless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The crime showed too much planning , the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Andy 's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stalled for a half-hour longer , hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the ransom money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Bake and Shirl Winter , on separate telephones , could not reach him at any conceivable location in Los Angeles , nor could they secure any clear-cut information regarding his efforts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bake cursed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The sweaty bastard 's probably halfway to Peru with our money by now '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When no one smiled , he felt constrained to add , `` Just kidding , natch '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thornburg popped in to advise , `` Andy , Skolman 's sending up smoke signals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You about ready '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What 's he complaining about '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bake asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They 're drinking , are n't they '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy overheard , `` They act more like a jury than an audience '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy said , `` Well , I guess we can n't wait any longer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hub , you stick by the stage door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If Rock shows up during the number - or you hear anything - give me the signal '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shirl Winter said , `` I 'll stay on the phone , Mr. Paxton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There 's a couple of call-backs I can work on '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're a sweetheart - but leave one line open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He may try to phone us '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Andy passed into the corridor , their `` good lucks '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">following him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different , as if he really needed it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The act , cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon , had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The result had nothing of the polish , pace or cohesion of the previous night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here 's where luck would normally step in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But this was no ordinary show and Andy knew it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The audience had come not to be entertained but to judge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Twenty-four hours had changed him from a performer to a freak .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Within this framework , what followed was strained , even macabre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The effect was as depressing as a gravestone , the applause irresolute and short-lived .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet Andy plowed ahead , mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning , and gradually his listeners warmed to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their clapping grew more fervent ; the evening was still not beyond salvaging , not as a show but for him as a person .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The worst was yet to come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As Andy reached the finale of his act , a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rocco Vecchio - a perspiring , haggard Vecchio - was standing there , flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He waved at Fox to cut off the finale introduction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The music died away discordantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He drew a deep breath .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Ladies and gentlemen , in place of my regular closing number tonight , I 'd like to sing something of a different nature for you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ray , if you please - the ' Cradle Song '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nor could he blame them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste , callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Having no choice , he plunged into it , anyway , holding onto the microphone for support .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Lullaby and goodnight '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">voice shook .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He wondered if the audience would let him finish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They did ; though contemptuous , they were still polite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But when he was finally through , their scorn was made apparent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Otherwise , the silence was complete .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As the lights came up , Andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stumbled off-stage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` My God '' , he muttered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` My God '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hub was there to support him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's okay , Mr. Paxton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The money 's here , all of it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At this moment , all he could think of was what he 'd been forced to undergo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Did you hear them ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do you know what they think of me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Bunch of damn jerks '' , Hub growled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Who needs them '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thornburg patted his arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sure , Andy , it 'll be all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nothing broken that can n't be mended '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The words were hollow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thornburg knew , better than any of them , that a public image was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All the king 's horses and all the king 's men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Vecchio shouldered in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I got it , Andy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">God knows how , but I got it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 'll never believe the places I 've been today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I practically had to sign your life away , you 'll probably fire me for some of the deals I had to go for , but '' -
Andy nodded dully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It does n't matter , Rock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We 've done our part '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent ; the place had the air of a morgue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Andy had no desire to linger himself but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers , merge without let .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Self 's integrity was and is and ever had been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves , the many threes-fulfilled on Mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on Earth - the unknown powers of three on Earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Mike remained in trance ; there was much to grok , loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing - all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel Foster Tabernacle ( not just cusp when he and Digby had come face to face alone ) - why Bishop Senator Boone made him warily uneasy , how Miss Dawn Ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and wailing -
Jubal 's conversations coming and going - Jubal 's words troubled him most ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The word `` church '' which turned up over and over again among Jubal 's words gave him knotty difficulty ; there was no Martian concept to match it - unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` congregation '' and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growing waiting & & & then forced the concept back into English in that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by Mahmoud , by Digby .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Thou art God '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was closer to understanding it in English now , although it could never have the inevitability of the Martian concept it stood for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In his mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer grokking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before midnight he speeded his heart , resumed normal breathing , ran down his check list , uncurled and sat up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had been weary ; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed , ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stepped out into the hall , was delighted to encounter a water brother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hi '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hello , Mike .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My , you look chipper '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I feel fine !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where is everybody '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Asleep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ben and Stinky went home an hour ago and people started going to bed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike felt disappointed that Mahmoud had left ; he wanted to explain his new grokking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I ought to be asleep , too , but I felt like a snack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are you hungry '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Sure , I'm hungry '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Come on , there 's some cold chicken and we 'll see what else '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They went downstairs , loaded a tray lavishly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Let 's take it outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It 's plenty warm '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` A fine idea '' , Mike agreed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Warm enough to swim - real Indian summer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I 'll switch on the floods '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't bother '' , Mike answered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll carry the tray '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He could see in almost total darkness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jubal said that his night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up , and Mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it ; his foster parents had taught him to see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As for the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on Mount Everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure ; he was considerate of their weakness , once he learned of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he was looking forward to snow - seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read - walking barefoot , rolling in it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Okay , take the tray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll switch on the underwater lights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 'll be plenty to eat by '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Fine '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mike liked having light up through the ripples ; it was a goodness , beauty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They picnicked by the pool , then lay back on the grass and looked at stars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mike , there 's Mars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is Mars , is n't it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or Antares '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It is Mars '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mike ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What are they doing on Mars '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hesitated ; the question was too wide for the sparse English language .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` On the side toward the horizon - the southern hemisphere - it is spring ; plants are being taught to grow '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` ' Taught to grow '' ' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hesitated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Larry teaches plants to grow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have helped him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But my people - Martians , I mean ; I now grok you are my people - teach plants another way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the other hemisphere it is growing colder and nymphs , those who stayed alive through the summer , are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Of the humans we left at the equator , one has discorporated and the others are sad '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yes , I heard it in the news `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike had not heard it ; he had not known it until asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` They should not be sad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Booker T. W. Jones Food Technician First Class is not sad ; the Old Ones have cherished him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You knew him '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had his own face , dark and beautiful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he was homesick '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , dear !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike & & & do you ever get homesick ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For Mars '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` At first I was homesick '' , he answered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I was lonely always '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He rolled toward her and took her in his arms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` But now I am not lonely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I grok I shall never be lonely again '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mike darling '' - They kissed , and went on kissing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Presently his water brother said breathlessly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , my !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was almost worse than the first time '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You are all right , my brother '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yes indeed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kiss me again '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A long time later , by cosmic clock , she said , `` Mike ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is that - I mean , ' Do you know '' ' -
`` I know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is for growing closer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now we grow closer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Well & & & I 've been ready a long time - goodness , we all have , but & & & never mind , dear ; turn just a little .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll help '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As they merged , grokking together , Mike said softly and triumphantly : `` Thou art God '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her answer was not in words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Then , as their grokking made them ever closer and Mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called him back : `` Oh !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oh !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thou art God '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We grok God '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On Mars humans were building pressure domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This went faster than scheduled as the Martians were helpful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of Mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Old Ones neither helped nor hindered this plan ; time was not yet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape Martian art for many millennia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On Earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation marks and spaces ; Time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the Federation Assembly Daily Record should be translated into the medium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and Mrs. Joseph Shadow of Greatness Douglas was quoted as saying : `` I would no more sit down without flowers on my table than without serviettes '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A Tibetan swami from Palermo , Sicily , announced in Beverly Hills a newly discovered , ancient yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His chelas were required to assume the matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud from Rig-Veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another room - nothing was stolen ; the purpose was less immediate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The President of the United States proclaimed the first Sunday in November as `` National Grandmothers ' Day '' and urged America to say it with flowers .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fosterite bishops , after secret conclave , announced the Church 's second Major Miracle : Supreme Bishop Digby had been translated bodily to Heaven and spot-promoted to Archangel , ranking with-but-after Archangel Foster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The glorious news had been held up pending Heavenly confirmation of the elevation of a new Supreme Bishop , Huey Short - a candidate accepted by the Boone faction after lots had been cast repeatedly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">L'Unita and Hoy published identical denunciations of Short 's elevation , l'Osservatore Romano and the Christian Science Monitor ignored it , Times of India snickered at it , and the Manchester Guardian simply reported it - the Fosterites in England were few but extremely militant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Digby was not pleased with his promotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Man from Mars had interrupted him with his work half finished - and that stupid jackass Short was certain to louse it up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Foster listened with angelic patience until Digby ran down , then said , `` Listen , junior , you 're an angel now - so forget it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eternity is no time for recriminations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Afterwards you did well enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now that Short is Supreme Bishop he 'll do all right , he can n't help it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Same as with the Popes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of them were warts until they got promoted .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Digby calmed down , but made one request .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Foster shook his halo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You can n't touch him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You should n't have tried to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oh , you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But , I'm telling you , it 'll be turned down - you do n't understand the System yet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Martians have their own setup , different from ours , and as long as they need him , we can n't touch him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They run their show their way - the Universe has variety , something for everybody - a fact you field workers often miss '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You mean this punk can brush me aside and I 've got to hold still for it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I held still for the same thing , did n't I ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm helping you now , am I not ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now look , there 's work to be done and lots of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Boss wants performance , not gripes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you need a Day off to calm down , duck over to the Muslim Paradise and take it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Otherwise , straighten your halo , square your wings , and dig in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sooner you act like an angel the quicker you 'll feel angelic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Get Happy , junior '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Okay , I'm Happy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where do I start '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Jubal did not hear of Digby 's disappearance when it was announced , and , when he did , while he had a fleeting suspicion , he dismissed it ; if Mike had had a finger in it , he had gotten away with it - and what happened to supreme bishops worried Jubal not at all as long as he was n't bothered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His household had gone through an upset .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom - and did n't want to inquire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Anyhow , it was high time the boy was salted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jubal could n't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting - ABC vs D , then BCD vs A & & & or AB vs CD , or AD vs CB , through all ways that four women can gang up on each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This continued most of the week following that ill-starred trip to church , during which period Mike stayed in his room and usually in a trance so deep that Jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone to pieces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing in `` to see if Mike was all right '' and they were too preoccupied to cook , much less be secretaries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even rock-steady Anne - Hell , Anne was the worst !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Absent-minded , subject to unexplained tears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jubal would have bet his life that if Anne were to witness the Second Coming , she would memorize date , time , personae , events , and barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The expense and time involved are astronomical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , we sent a third vessel out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago ; that is all I can tell you about them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But the third ship came back several years ago and reported & & & '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">said Hal , forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Macneff stopped pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How did you know '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he said sharply .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Forgive me , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But it was inevitable !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did not the Forerunner predict in his Time and the World Line that such a planet would be found ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I believe it was on page 573 '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Macneff smiled and said , `` I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How could they not ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">thought Hal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides , they were not the only impressions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I still bear scars on my back where Pornsen , my gapt , whipped me because I had not learned my lessons well enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was a good impresser , that Pornsen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As I grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where I was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was my gapt in the creche .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was the dormitory gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is now my block gapt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is the one responsible for my getting such low M.R. 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Swiftly , came the revulsion , the protest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No , not he , for I , and I alone , am responsible for whatever happens to me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If I get a low M. R. , I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If I die , I die because I willed it so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So , forgive me , Sigmen , for the contrary to reality thoughts !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Please pardon me again , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` But did the expedition find any records of the Forerunner having been on this planet ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps , even , though this is too much to wish , find the Forerunner himself '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' , said Macneff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Though that does not mean that there may not be such records there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I can n't tell you now the distance in light years or what star this was , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you volunteer , you will be told where you 're going after the ship leaves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And it leaves very soon '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You need a linguist '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">said Hal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The ship is huge '' , said Macneff , `` but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Unfortunately & & & '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , he said , `` Unfortunately , only one lamechian linguist exists , and he is too old for this expedition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Therefore & & & '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` A thousand pardons '' , said Hal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But I have just thought of one thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am married '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No problem at all '' , said Macneff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There will be no women aboard the Gabriel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And , if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hal gasped , and he said , `` A divorce '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said , `` You are horrified , of course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But , from our reading of the Western Talmud , we Urielites believe that the Forerunner , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's inevitable in this case , for the couple will be separated for , at the least , forty years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Naturally , he couched the provision in obscure language .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In his great and glorious wisdom , he knew that our enemies the Israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I volunteer '' , said Hal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tell me more , Sandalphon '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Six months later , Hal Yarrow stood in the observation dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was night on this hemisphere , but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia , Japan , China , Southeast Asia , India , Siberia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hal , the linguist , saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Australia , the Philippine Islands , Japan , and northern China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac Union that spoke American .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Southern China , all of southeast Asia , southern India and Ceylon , these states of the Malay Federation spoke Bazaar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Siberia spoke Icelandic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His mind turned the globe swiftly for him , and he visualized Africa , which used Swahili south of the Sahara Sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All around the Mediterranean Sea , Asia Minor , northern India , and Tibet , Hebrew was the native tongue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In southern Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was no man's land , disputed by the Haijac Union and the Israeli Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Neither nation would give up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Its citizens spoke all of the world 's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth : Iceland , Greenland , the Caribbean Islands , and the eastern half of South America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here the peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the Hawaiian Americans who were busy resettling North America and the western half of South America after the Apocalyptic War .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then there was North America , where American was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of French-Canadians living on the Hudson Bay Preserve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen City would blaze out into space .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But Mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be dry eyed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no such thing as an `` accident '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hal felt sorry for Mary ; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet , he told himself , this was the best way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He and Mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other ; their mutual torture would be over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mary was free to marry again , not knowing that the Sturch had secretly given her a divorce , thinking that death had dissolved her marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She would have a year in which to make up her mind , to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps , the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hal 's child would no longer be present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hal doubted if this happy event would occur .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mary was as frozen below the navel as he .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The gapt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pornsen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He would no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hal Yarrow '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">said the whining voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And , slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal turned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was the squat loose jowled man , smiling lopsidedly up at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` My beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , said the whining voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I had no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I might have known !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We seem to be bound by love ; Sigmen himself must have foreseen it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Love to you , my ward '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Sigmen love you , too , my guardian '' , said Hal , choking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` How wonderful to see your cherished self .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I had thought we would never again speak to each other '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under one gee acceleration , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity , 99.1 percent of the speed of light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the suspensor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They would sleep while the Gabriel 's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Upon reaching the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey 's end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many years later , the photon counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Again , a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one gee deceleration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And , in the half year left before reaching their destination , the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen , Siddo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And , from the first , he faced a difficult task .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And , as Hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This discovery caused Hal anxiety .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet , if he used all of the little means at his disposal , he would be instructing his students wrongly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For one thing , the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen 's ; the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider the tense system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Plus the fact that Siddo not only had the normal ( to Earthmen ) three genders of masculine , feminine , and neuter , but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fortunately , gender was inflected , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The system of indicating gender varied according to tense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All the other parts of speech : nouns , pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would n't matter to a fool like you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would to me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` All right '' , Wilson said quickly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The fire 's too big .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And I appreciate the advice '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was losing patience again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had helped him change his mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm not advising you '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm telling you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That fire 's too big .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let it burn down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And make sure it 's out when you leave in the morning '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was taken aback .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It took him a long time to compose himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` There 's some mistake '' , he said finally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're right about the fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's bigger than it has to be , though I do n't see where it 's doing any harm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But you 're wrong about the rest of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm not leaving in the morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why should I ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I own the place '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It did n't seem to tell her anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She glanced around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground , the two kids , the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She studied it for a long time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he was n't quite sure what she meant by it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You own this place '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">she said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You bought it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` From a man in St. Louis '' , Wilson said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Jake Carwood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe you know him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The girl laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I know him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I ought to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My father ran him off here six years ago '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wilson did n't say anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Carwood did n't tell you that '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' , Wilson said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` But it 's understandable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And it does n't make any difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He sold me a clear title .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have it with me , right here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you want to see '' -
`` Never mind '' , she said sternly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` It would n't matter to my father , and not to me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I meant what I said about that fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Be sure it 's out when you leave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll let you go back to doing the dishes now '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was meant to insult him , and did n't quite succeed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't mind washing dishes now and then '' , he said pleasantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` It does n't hurt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It might hurt you , though .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Somebody might mistake you for a woman '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He meant to say more , but he never got the chance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was quick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She brought the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She swung the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She came down against him , and he tried to break her fall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It made him a little sick , and he let go of her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wiped the blood from his cheek .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I ought to '' - he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` That quirt - I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you were a man '' -
`` She is n't , mister '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The voice came from behind him , and Wilson turned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , Wilson thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he was handsome , despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She 's not a man , mister '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I am .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you 've got any ideas '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson 's chest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Put the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She seemed irritated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I thought I told you to stay home '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The scar looked pure white in the half darkness ; his eyes were black and deep-set , and expressionless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You should n't be riding up here after dark , Judith '' , he said quietly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I can take care of this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's no job for you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He took it without flinching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I said go home , Joseph .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 've got no business up here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The half-breed did n't answer this time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It made Wilson wonder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He watched the half-breed as he turned silently .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They could hear the pony 's feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wilson brushed the dust from his coat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Who was that '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Your personal guard ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 're pretty hard on him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He works for my father '' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 's a friend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His name 's Joseph Sanchez .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is there anything else you want to know '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not now '' , Wilson said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I guess I 'll find out soon enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 've got blood on your cheek .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not yours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It must have got there when you fell against me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'll bet that 's as close as you 've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've had enough of that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 've had enough of you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I do n't know what goes on around here , and I do n't care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I do n't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and I do n't care about that , either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You took me by surprise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I 'll know how to handle you next time '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had forgotten that she was so pretty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward :
cruelty , meanness , self-will .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had known women like that , one woman in particular .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And one had been too many .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he could n't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were n't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had n't shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And determined not to show it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Go to sleep '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Both of you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There 's better things to do than listen to something like that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The coyote was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not tonight , at any rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If she did , he could stand it better in the light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house , his hopes had been high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Already some of the pain had gone from Amelia 's death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not all of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But they were starting a new life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And they had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The land was n't all Wilson had expected of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; good grass , good water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The water was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And there was a house ; livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the last analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to complain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The place had been cheap - just the little he had left after Amelia 's burial - and it would serve its purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was only one place where Jake Carwood 's description had gone badly awry : the peace and quiet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It had n't started out that way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he had a feeling - thanks to the girl - that things would get worse before they got better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kathy was already in the wagon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were going to town , and they were both excited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wilson backed the team into the traces , and wished they were n't going to town at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had an uneasy feeling about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That girl last night , what was her name ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Judith Pierce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle would n't stop to graze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there was water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yes , there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The town was about what Wilson expected : one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings , a water tower , a few warehouses , a single hotel ; all dusty and sunbaked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The place was quiet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening - its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Old Man was unimportant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; or the smell of thick tomato paste - the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour - rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly dotted cheesecloth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or the bay of female dogs in heat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They never called him by name , although he had one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Filippo Rossi , that 's what he was called in the old country ; but here he was just Signore or the Old Man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Youth obeyed when commanded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But youth asked nothing of its parents - not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the past was dead here as the present was dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once the Old Man had had a wife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And once she , too , ignored him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin covered buttocks down the street before him and did n't stop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The way she strutted down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars , rode away in it , and never came back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` But she should n't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , no .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not that one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Eh , Torino !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She gave herself fancy airs !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Henh '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mauve colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man 's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Puttana '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed - watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His voice had not commanded her to stop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It had not questioned why .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( He was never without that dog . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And his eyes - those miniature sundials of variegated yellow - had not altered their expression or direction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Old Man 's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he would n't have had anyone know it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">But when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the outskirts of Philadelphia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city 's center at half-hour intervals ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To him they were one and the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sameness lined the streets with two story houses the color of ash .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It slashed the sloping manure scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even the stable garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And the coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That was Bartoli 's shop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Above it , from a second story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did the Old Man remember them there ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks - like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man 's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They kept him alive , waiting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was holding out for something .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was determined to hold out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Old Man 's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he would be a man , he would be a rich man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in white columned houses on the other side of the park .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would not carry a brief case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nor would he work at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , `` At your service '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff - he would not remove his gloves - and light and smoke .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could do that when he would be a man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hey , Laura '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he called to his sister on the porch above the steps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was only ten months older than he .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Laura did not answer him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes - toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was never sure they fully took him in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` She 's in a mood '' , he thought `` There 's not a month she does n't get herself in a mood '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not even Laura .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat 's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Christ sake , goat , git '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the goat would not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're boiling milk , ai n't you '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">soothing it with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pompeii rolled over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The boy 's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the boy could see only the goat 's belly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Time enough to give up his soul .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii 's shaved hair , edged up close to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta 's idiot brother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pompeii expected Romeo 's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He expected Concetta 's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nothing in English has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ben Franklin said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. Fogg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You explain English by Greek '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Richard Brinsley Sheridan said , `` I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And a witty American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can n't understand his own meaning '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In common parlance they would be described as misses - misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` Did you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane said you never said what I said '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another woman , addressing Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they did n't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they 'll think we won't send them one because they did n't last year , do n't you think , or shall we '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ambiguity of a non repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I did n't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind - and he seems to have misunderstood me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply do n't understand women .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mr. Jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They recall Byron 's classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Similarly , when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in cryptic fashion , Lincoln refused to make any further statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I fear explanations explanatory of things explained '' , he said , leaving the biter bit - and bitter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Senator '' , said an interviewer , `` your constituents can n't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Good '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">replied the Senator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It took me five hours to write it that way '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain :
`` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a drunken spree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now can you tell me who was drunk - The man , his wife , or me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The `` wooden-leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , had endless variations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` '' There 's a man outside with a wooden leg named Smith `` .
''</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What 's the name of his other leg `` '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another stock vaudeville gag ran : `` Mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When radio came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` '' Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on `` ?
''</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I see the girl but I do n't see the car with slacks on `` '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman : `` Excuse me , but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter 's handbag and my wife 's behind '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than * * f inches '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Readers of the Reader 's Digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a California paper that advertised `` House for rent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">View takes in five counties , two bedrooms '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Officials Meet on Rubbish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many Shapes in Bathtubs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Son and Daughter of Local Couple Married '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese , journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A weekly newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last Saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription , adding : `` I personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then there was the caterer 's ad which read : `` Are you getting married or having an affair ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This slip is so-called because its semi ambiguous English always seems to refer to a person 's anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Samples :
He walked in upon her invitation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He kissed her back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` While Henry Morgan was escorting Miss Vera Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr. Morgan on the public square '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` The area in which Miss N - was injured is spectacularly scenic '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Strangely enough , this always brought the house down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Apart from journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor 's notes on an emergency case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It read : `` Shot in the lumbar region '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the record : `` Shot in the woods '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I want the fish served whole , with head and tail '' , the epicure explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The maid demurred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's silly - lemon in mouth '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners , the girl reluctantly agreed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which I made each of us a new drink .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The world that was once foot-loose and fancy-free '' , he said , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy free .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One day , the children had wanted to get up onto General Burnside 's horse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They wanted to see what his back felt like - the General 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He looked so comfortable being straight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They wanted to touch the mystery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was very rude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The policeman 's eyes rather popped for a second ; but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it was n't for these dear children '' - .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` Now , look here , lady : I know you got to entertain these kids and all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But this is a public park and it 's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The policeman walked on , but he looked back once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; and they had told their mother about the tumbles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; and so they were consistently true to their principles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Never mind '' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Never mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` What is it '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British movie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First , Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They had protested that that was n't any surprise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` This is a warm-up '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Is it anything like cooked over oatmeal '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">asked one of the children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But not hard for very long .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just long enough to make you feel important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Now '' , said Arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Now , we 're going to be like what General Burnside and his horse make us think of '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their curiosity went happily out of bounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Imagine being able to laugh and wink when you 're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They both laughed and winked back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I'm General Burnside 's horse , upside down '' , Arlene said , sort of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She made General Burnside 's horse 's belly do so funny when it was upside down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then , she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And she would wink and throw kisses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But they kept on clapping for a long , long time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` This time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you 're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It all has something to do with General Burnside and his horse '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">This time , it was so grand ; they could tell exactly what it was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was General Burnside 's horse running in a circle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's the General 's horse '' , one of them cried out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` That 's a funny old horse '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first one said , `` He sure does shake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's old '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then there was the General kissing his wife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had to be told that one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it was even funnier after they had been told .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Their father , when he came back from those many business trips , just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But not General Burnside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was the funniest man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He never could keep still , even when he did n't move his feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then , they had to get up and be General Burnside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or his horse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All they could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was n't very funny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , they said General Burnside was going to jump over his horse 's head ; and they did some somersaults .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But that was n't very funny , either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You ought to shake '' , Arlene advised them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And Arlene showed them how to begin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">She also taught them to sing `` I wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That helped a lot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were clumsy , but they were beginning to catch on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Imagine you won't get your allowance if you 're caught not smiling - or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , Arlene suggested .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That helped a great deal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were a little late in getting home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I'm sorry , Mrs. Minks '' , Arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My mother constituted herself the voice of all of us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` It 's perfectly understandable , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I suppose you all were playing and forgot '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , ma'am '' , the children chorused heartily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We could n't help laughing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters ; and Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Arlene 's a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That tap had a slight bang ish quality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` She really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her upper lip lifted slightly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was biting into a small red radish ; and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It never worked , naturally ; but it made her look unusual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , when she had bitten off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; and she would snatch the finger held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Actually , it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Later on , the children told her further about somersaulting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It must be awfully good for them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And awfully kind of Arlene '' , she told us later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But do you know something curious '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she added .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have no notion why I reached .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I found a radish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was it an omen ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I thought for a second .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I would not pamper myself in that silly way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I opened the window and threw the radish out '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then , my mother blushed at this small lie ; for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Arlene became indispensable ; nobody could have told why .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But she was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was in the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A friend of my father 's came to dinner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was passing through town and phoned to say hello .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a result , he was persuaded out to dinner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes , he coincided with my father 's being at home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he was always persuaded out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">he liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he had left , I could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The children loathed him , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There had been some coconut in it , for I remember my mother 's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a shiver .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were pushed gently into the room by Arlene - whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We had just sat down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Tell Mr. Gorboduc what you 're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , ceremonially .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was an air of revolt about the children - even irreverence for their own principles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This could be told chiefly from a sort of head tossing and prancing , a horse like balkiness of demeanor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Possibly , the coconut containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But , at the beginning , this stayed just in the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We go to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We have good times '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This happy bulletin convulsed Mr. Gorboduc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You do '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked , between wheezes of laughter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was forced to wipe his eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You do n't step on the flowers , do you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eh '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We do n't '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Gorboduc took a swig of his sherry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Usually , this was done when attention was diverted by someone else 's long , boring story .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But this time she was nervous : she was open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tell me - what do you do at the park '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This was delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over pretended interest - an admirable way with children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We bump '' , one said ; and the other went on to development of the idea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We grind , too '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My mother was beside herself with curiosity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Say that again '' , she pleaded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You what '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She could see that Mr. Gorboduc was intrigued ; the hostess in her took over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was rollickingly happy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You what '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My uncle looked at Mr. Gorboduc .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He read Henry James and used to pretend profundity through eye-beamings at people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Gorboduc looked down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would not look up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was very funny about the whole thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pueri Aquam De Silvas Ad Agricolas Portant , a delightful vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre Punic War Rome .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After a `` busy '' overture , the curtain rises on a farm scene - the Ranavan Valley in northern Maine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A dead armadillo , the sole occupant of the stage , symbolizes the crisis and destruction of the Old Order .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Old Order , acted and atonally sung by Grunnfeu Arapacis , the lovely Serbantian import , then entered and delivered the well-known invocation to the god Phineoppus , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering Gorshek priests , symbolizing Love , Lust , Prudence and General Motors , respectively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">According to the myth , Old Order then vanishes at stage left and reappears at extreme stage right , but director Shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply having Miss Arapacis walk across the stage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The night we saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo , complaining - in ad-lib - that `` it smelled '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's somewhat off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety and charm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originated in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find out if he was a member of Major Pockmanster 's Delhi Regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in that outfit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Breeze And Chancellor Neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster cast of the Apollo Belvedere .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed through middle Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a Venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against the English at Dunkirk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As we find out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian blind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After a few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that Neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at times a bit obscure , the film is certainly a much needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">THE MUSIC OF BINI SALFININISTAS , CAPITAL LP 63711 - R , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed through his `` purgatory '' of neglect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc Schlek , Jr. , a major revival is under way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As he leads the Neurenschatz Skolkau Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor 's insistence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Not only was Haumd 's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F major register up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at the same time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist 's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As Broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas , the American theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance in that nebulous area known as `` off-Broadway '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger Entwhistle , a former University of Maryland chemistry instructor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie , gets a plate of English muffins instead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks Atkinson retired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant terrible Francoisette Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The Lascivious Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A biting , pithy parable of the all pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by Mlle Lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over and over by four thousand French horns ) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul Sartre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Petite , lovely Yvette Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born Free , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max Fink 's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My Friend , the Quizzical Salamander .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother 's pet salamander , Alicia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is not an entirely happy book , as Mrs. Fink soon becomes jealous of Alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Max , in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's disease and dies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This brief resume hardly does the book justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Fing , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir Cedric Hardwicke , is responsible for the rediscovery of Verdi 's earliest , most raucous opera , Nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the Mudugno version of `` Volare '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Miss Pulova has a voice that Maria Callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw driver '' , and her round , opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of Rosalie .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself '' ( De Gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' !</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Soaring to stardom along with him , Margo Felicity Brighetti , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet , turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The battle of the drib-drool continues , but most of New York 's knowing sophisticates of Abstract Expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of V ( for Vindication ) Day , September first , when Augustus Quasimodo 's first one-man show opens at the Guggenheim .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have heard that after seeing Mr. Quasimodo 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it is thought by many who think about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De Kooning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz Kline and myself , `` the nothing that is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non time '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The Invasion of Cuba '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this work , his use of non color is startling and skillful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dear Sirs : Let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds , wherever you are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is , I am reliably given to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; i.e. , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Far from it ; I merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Above all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a few objets d'art , or to shame you into rectitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be in your shoes for all the rice in China .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria dell 'Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hastening to the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What you were looking for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed oak Victrola , you danced two tangos and a paso doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You then descended one story , glommed a television set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way - and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade handled magnifying glass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box Kodaks , you added to your haul .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then , having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So much for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The foregoing , aided by several clues I 'll withhold to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector Javert , but before they close in , gird yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Fourteen of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's evil , sheep rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All this , though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , I can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you 've affronted and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hold on tight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First of all , the six figures of the Buddha you heisted - four Siamese heads , a black obsidian statuette in the earth touching position , and a large brass figure of the Dying Buddha on a teakwood base .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods , much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest .

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the Wheel of the Law specifies ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the Presence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Eight or ten years ago , a couple of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee Guimet , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed One to forgive their desecration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let 's resume our catalogue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The three Indian brass deities , though - Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna - are an altogether different cup of tea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They hail from Travancore , a state in the subcontinent where Kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it is the wooden sculpture from Bali , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish , that I particularly call to your attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oddly enough , this is an amulet against housebreakers , presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Inscribed around its base is a charm in Balinese , a dialect I take it you do n't comprehend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Neither do I , but the Tjokorda Agoeng was good enough to translate , and I 'll do as much for you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whosoever violates our rooftree , the legend states , can expect maximal sorrow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley car will grow in his stomach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore - and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note - it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Still , there it is .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , you no doubt regard the preceding as pap ; you 're tooling around full of gage in your hot rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like Ubermenschen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In that case , listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A couple of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer 's boy , a thoroughly bad hat , who delivered cartons to the people overhead .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I learned , for example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His energy was prodigious ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Evenings , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico + Paglieri's or Peter's Backyard drunkenly donning ladies ' hats and singing `` O Sole Mio '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Well , the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who could n't retaliate , and in due course , as was inevitable , overreached himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One morning , we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The next time we saw him , he was a changed person ; he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkles , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the top .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70 th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur - and very capable as a professional musician .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post World War 1 , era .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prokofieff 's outlook as a composer pianist conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Prokofieff 's Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the Neo Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What was it to Prokofieff ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18 th Century ideas ; a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; a brilliant piece de resistance ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All musical Paris was there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The answer is , `` Yes '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His life-long friend , Serge Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New York , and Washington , D. C. , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love for Three Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Uncle Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden Twenties '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So young Prokofieff was the darling of success :
in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting grounds of `` Uncle Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native land .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation - hunger and exposure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism - producing music for the masses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But no : Prokofieff grew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He accepted the environment of his destiny - took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose - the clarity must be new , not old '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How right he was ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words - with torrents of powerful music .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth Symphony ; or the Love for Three Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , The Stone Flower .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , in all of Prokofieff 's music , young or mature , we find his profile - his `` signature '' - his craftsman 's attitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That Prokofieff 's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; yet was never caught up in it - never a slave to its academic dialectics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World - not his experimentations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His fellow countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while Stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff 's own words :
`` the clarity must be new , not old '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shaped his talents to his purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people - by the compass of their national ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations - representing many peoples , time periods and styles - into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations - his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre du Printemps , his incisive Les Noces - the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But time is running out , and many of Stravinsky 's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself : Supra Expressionism , Neo Paganism , Neo Classicism , Neo Romanticism , Neo Jazz , Neo Ecclesiasticism , Neo Popularism , and most recently , Post Serialism - all competing with each other within one composer !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem ( The Star-Spangled Banner ) ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; a circus polka for elephants ; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How differently Prokofieff 's life unfolded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">With a large and circumspect 20 th Century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children 's fairy tales - Slavic dances and love songs - into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; time and economic security ; symphony orchestras , opera and ballet companies ; choruses , chamber music ensembles ; soloists ; recordings ; broadcastings ; television ; large and eager audiences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive :
economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology - a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">That he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; and perhaps of even greater significance - his music is strong 20 th Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">April 10 marked a memorable date in New York 's musical history - indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30 th anniversary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Roy Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is this subject matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seals - bore no relation to the painting of pictures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had - and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together - Roy developed his art by himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form ; color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; and that over all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony :
`` Of late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values - the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark - by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call ' clicking ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details - all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The longer I work , the more I am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` As for materials , I use the best available .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my studio I work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an English make , rough surface , in 400 - pound weight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` In addition to the usual tools , I make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I also use a small electric hand blower to dry large washes in the studio .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` My brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for I combine the sable and the bristle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The red sables are 8 ; two riggers , 6 and 10 ; and a very large , flat wash brush .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` My usual palette consists of top-quality colors :
alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , French ultramarine blue , Winsor green , Hooker's green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , Payne's gray , charcoal gray , Davy's gray , and ivory black '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The artist was born in Gilbert Mills , New York , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New York , in Batavia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15 th , I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist :
the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 - March 20 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again , in his natal month of March !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; two Ranger Fund purchase awards ; the Joseph Pennell Memorial Medal ; two American Watercolor Society prizes ; the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor , Art Institute of Chicago ; and others in Buffalo , New York , Chautauqua , New Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most recently , the $ 300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach Art Association ,
He was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other memberships include the American Watercolor Society , Philadelphia Water Color Club , Allied Artists of America , Audubon Artists , Baltimore Watercolor Society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow 's commonplace equipment originates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color - TV system to view the results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">By combining the talents of a medical man , Dr. Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr. Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr. Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead of the observer 's eye the image orthicon in the TV camera does the `` looking '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( Note :
Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This assembly also supplies a 20 - cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is the same system as was used in the field sequential color TV system which preceded the present simultaneous system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three separate amplifiers then drive a 21 - inch tricolor tube .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color TV picture reveal a wealth of detail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The medical title of `` Lobar Ventilation in Man '' by Drs. C. J. Martin and A. C. Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the University of Washington Medical School , the electronics group has developed the `` Respiratory Gas Analyzer '' shown in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">3 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient 's breathing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the lower center rack an 8 - channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today 's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes about 16 | msec.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">to traverse 25 mm.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">of tissue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A sonar or radar type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body tissue evaluation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart 's left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">in diameter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Battery life limited the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs. Zworykin and Farrar and Mr. Berkely of the Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing transducer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As shown in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400 - kc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">bursts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through '' human organs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr. G. Baum who has explored the human eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">6 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For display , Dr. Baum uses a portion of an * * f , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">5 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90 - degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into '' all corners .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90 - degree rotation period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Drs. Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in Fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">8 with the various parts labeled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oersted 's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south central part of Denmark on August 14 , 1777 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oldenburg 's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town 's learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The mayor of the town taught them English and French .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I lived in this onward driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` Limits of Poetry and Prose '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Han 's student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was stirred by the announcement of Volta 's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He also met Count Rumford ( born Benjamin Thompson in Woburn, Mass . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">who was then serving the Elector of Bavaria , and the physicist Ritter ; these were Oersted 's main contacts in science .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From Go ^ ttingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented , I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in Copenhagen I used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host 's fertile but disorganized mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oersted remodeled Ritter 's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut de France for its annual prize of 3000 francs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In May , 1803 , Ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden '' jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ritter proceeded , `` You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This we might well witness '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university 's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">During Oersted 's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted 's disposal during and after his graduation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches sur l ' identite des forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication ; but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His plan and intent were clearly charted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He continued as a popular lecturer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm , one of the Danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , Lauritz Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted 's first demonstration of his discovery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the late 1700 's Beccaria and van Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause and effect relationship between these two primary forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oersted 's own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted 's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Need for service is here to stay - and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are two reasons for this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First , most products tend to become more complex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Good service starts with product design and planning :
Many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To the manufacturer of the more convenient type product - the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely - the implications are important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Your competition is now proportionately greater - you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer 's dollar being spent on their particular products .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The trends have been in evidence for many years - population shifts to the Southwest and Far West , and from city to suburbs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These shifts will continue in the next 10 yr. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry - at both the manufacturing and retail ends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention - practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer 's as well as the distributor 's profits - which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality - and the customer seems to have caught on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If private brand competition has n't been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Display merchandising , backed by pre selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you have a higher quality product , how can you make it stand out - justify its premium price - without the spoken word ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Salesmanship is still necessary , but it 's a different brand of salesmanship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The use of bulk handling is continuously growing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Selective selling '' - concentrating sales on the larger accounts - has been used effectively by some manufacturers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully - and with some imagination ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower paid salesmen ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In one company covering the country with a high quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the manufacturer 's point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is accentuated by the need for pre selling goods , and private label competition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are you following competition willy-nilly - trying to match dollar for dollar - or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program - from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Will you be out in the market place with some of these sales building new products ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is your R + D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R + D people ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans - and management could n't make up its mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a shortage of salesmen today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yr. ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today - and it will be tougher in the future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going to be harder to apply .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They have to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">With greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can n't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible - or at least not as economically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do you have a long-term ( 5 - or 10 - yr . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">marketing program ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company 's marketing problems realistically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and , consequently , increased productivity ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What effort do you make to assess results of your program ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Do you measure its relation to reduced absenteeism , turnover , accidents , and grievances , and to improved quality and output ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Have you set specific objectives for your employee publication ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is it reaching these goals ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Is it larger or fancier than you really need ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Are you using the most economical printing methods , paper , etc. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are there other , cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted ?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do n't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker 's relation to the deceased must be to qualify .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin 's funeral .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you 'll probably never use it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Otherwise , you may be saddled with a good size milk bill by milk drinkers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Make sure you have minimum age and time on the job requirements tied into your pension plan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Younger men usually do n't think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they 're liable to change jobs several times before settling down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Choose carefully between contributory or non contributory pension plans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are two sides of a coin for this decision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A non contributory plan usually won n't pay off for the worker until he retires .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Make sure you do n't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These include :
leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">It 's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington 's birthday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This cuts the absentee rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won n't blame the concessionaire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 'll take the rap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Check your cafeteria location to make sure it 's convenient for most employees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You may save valuable production minutes with a change .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This will cut the expense of vacation replacements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The long and ever increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain - a few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sporting firearms change , markedly for the better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today 's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow firing single shot arms with modern fast firing autoloaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today 's hunting and target shooting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And due to modern resource use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever expanding encroachment on land and water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game management ) for five and six months each year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Close to two million game birds were harvested on 1500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on State Game Commission controlled upland game areas during the 1960 - 61 season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The shooting development program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New York staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Following the kick-off of SAAMI 's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in Washington , D. C. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The group known as the American Association for Health , Physical Education , and Recreation ( a division of the National Education Association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the National Rifle Association , SAAMI and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr. Julian Smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This program is now nationally known as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first program was sponsored by Abraham + Strauss , Hempstead , New York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other pilot programs were conducted by A + S , Babylon , New York ; J. L. Hudson , Detroit ; Joseph Horne , Pittsburgh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Other THC activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio - TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">SAAMI 's field men have served as consultants and / or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic young Americans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Through the efforts of SAAMI 's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since SAAMI 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life - ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ask Sammy Shooter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina 's famed Outer Banks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , Pop tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70 mile long National Seashore Recreation Area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Camping is big and getting bigger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No one knows where it will stop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The number depends on who is talking at the moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The figures range as high as 15 million families .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I 'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The National Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to have 30000 campsites available for 100000 campers a day - almost twice what there are at present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The U. S. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the campers still come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Among them , according to the U. S. Department of Commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Camping is family fun , and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The American Automobile Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $ 29 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The AAA then splits it down this way : $ 10.50 for meals , $ 9.50 for lodging , $ 7 for gas and oil , and $ 2 for tips and miscellaneous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The $ 9.50 for lodging they save .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $ 10.50 food bill along with most of the tip money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can n't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they 're buying the comforts of home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They 're not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Home is the place to find the comforts of home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They 're buying fun and adventure and family experiences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Today 's campers want comforts , and they have them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's fun , and it 's easy - so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Camp meals are no great problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everything else is closed away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is the ideal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a growing number of American homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics - not the husband .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant - nature has seen to that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To many experts , this trend was inevitable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They consider it simply a sign of our times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It can , in fact , wreck a marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife 's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often - since private affairs rarely remain private - to the outside world as well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband 's maleness '' , declares Dr. Calderone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This opinion is supported by one of the nation 's leading psychiatrists , Dr. Maurice E. Linden , director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker 's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Caught at last , he was sentenced to prison .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While he was in custody his wife divorced him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One wife , described by a New York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood card parties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip - often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job - often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is : `` Do n't rock the boat '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The wife 's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife 's mercy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` The pattern '' , says Dr. Morton Schillinger , psychologist at New York 's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr. Schillinger points out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore , Dr. Calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are n't `` frigid '' and they are n't homosexual ; they 're just restrained in all of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They like to be dominated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik , New York psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Asked why , he replied primly :
`` Because that 's no activity for a gentleman '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But such cases were , in the past , unusual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male - even the Bible appears to endorse the concept .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Family survival on our own Western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man 's strength and ability to bring home the bacon ; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This carried over into the more urbanized late 19 th and early 20 th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull roaring Life With Father manner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Grandma was n't expected to like it '' , Dr. Marion Hilliard , the late Toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the ' 90 s .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used '' by their husbands - and , history indicates , they often quite literally were .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When was the turning point ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child rearing , money handling and home maintenance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Very few wives '' , says Dr. Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Marriage manuals and women 's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They began to describe in detail the woman 's capacity for response .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr. Albert Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">According to Dr. Ellis , the average 20 - year old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr. Maurice Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` When the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife 's aggressiveness '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One such wife , Dr. Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then the wife bed hopped to the next on the list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed - the one place he can still be champion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man - or his wife - because he or she feels age creeping up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive - asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple 's own affair , and can n't always be measured by a general yardstick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates '' , Dr. Calderone declares .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Too many husbands , Dr. Schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they 're doing '' , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Farming is confining .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The farmer 's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Livestock must be tended every day , routinely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; such a move may mean a loss of capital .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of farm life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Production may fall far below expectations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his capital .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off farm job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If the farm is rented , the rent must be paid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment - or a great deal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">General requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you 'll need more land .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In deciding how much land you want , take into account the amount you 'll need to bring in the income you expect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is a highly speculative venture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you have a year-round , full-time job you can n't expect to grow much more than your family uses - unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a rule , part-time farmers hire little help .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Do not include all your spare time or all your family 's spare time - only what you are willing to use for farm work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For larger plantings , you 'll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $ 300 to $ 500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed - such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder - it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Before you look for a farm you 'll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake ; and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then if you change jobs you won n't necessarily have to sell the farm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Obviously the farm should be on an all weather road .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are slums in the country as well as in the city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Few rural areas are protected by zoning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A tavern , filling station , junk yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten - the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David - nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department of Jewish Affairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin 's dictatorship ; in the United States the initiation of militant anti Communism , with the repentant ex Communist in the vanguard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These trials were properly termed `` political cases '' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of what new course could it mark the beginning ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are Jews .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' - said Ben Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone - but anti-Semitism throughout history '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-Semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; but he believed in the Jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich Minister of the Interior , the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan , the Reich Minister of Justice , the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This , in fact , it turned out to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull bashings and gassings ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann 's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization :
fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the Trial should have asked the nations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Poughkeepsie , N. Y. , in 1952 , a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In New York City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A year later in Albany , N. Y. , a Roman Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood Association .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family welfare agencies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` All too frequently '' , points out James O' Gara , managing editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All too often our language is unduly harsh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Pope Pius 12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics in family planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Roman Catholic Church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature 's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Here is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The latter plays a prominent role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature , Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why is it so different in regard to birth control ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof , upon others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider what happened during World War 1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian countries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Today , the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The various Lambeth Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants generally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In 1920 , the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In 1930 , the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many other Protestant denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified artificial methods of birth control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` As to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since then , many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National Council of Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the US .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The general board declared : `` Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil law is concerned with public crimes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Among the chief victims of such an ill conceived imposition would be religion itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On April 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three masted bark , Discovery , weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool , London , and floated down the Thames toward the sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Seventeen months later , on September 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The captain was gone , and the mate was gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What happened to the fourteen missing men ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain 's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man 's desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All told , they offered a highly confused picture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain - a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on American towns and counties , on a great American river , and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The name : Henry Hudson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able - or ever , probably , will be able - to determine :
The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson 's fourth in four years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each time his objective had been the same - a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1607 and 1608 , the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1609 , the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This time he turned westward , to the middle Atlantic coast of North America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His chief discovery was important - the Great North ( later , the Hudson ) River - but it produced no northwest passage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson 's findings leaked out , and English interest in him revived .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry , Prince of Wales .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact , Hudson 's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nearly twenty-five years before , Captain John Davis had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic Circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He named this opening , between Baffin Island and Labrador , the `` Furious Overfall '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( Later , it was to be called Hudson Strait . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long sought waterway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even Hudson , experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ahead were perilous , ice filled waters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will - which was obviously not the case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the third voyage , a near mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid Atlantic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of only one could he be sure - young John Hudson , his second son .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The mate , Robert Juet , who had kept the journal on the half Moon , was experienced - but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Philip Staffe , the ship 's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest - lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he refused to be anything else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was a Londoner , married , with three sons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In 1610 , Hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hudson 's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There at the river 's edge waited one Henry Greene , whom Hudson listed as a `` clerk '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred - pimps , panders and whores .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend , where the Discovery picked him up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain , then turned westward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On May 11 , she reached Iceland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` Lousie Bay '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With Hudson looking on , his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship 's surgeon , Edward Wilson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The issue was settled on shore , Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With difficulty , Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from Iceland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Early in June , the Discovery passed `` Desolation '' ( southern Greenland ) and in mid-June entered the `` Furious Overfall '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Floating ice bore down from the north and west .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fog hung over the route constantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The ship 's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As the bergs grew larger , Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay , an inlet of the great strait .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice filled passageway - and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The trouble was at least partly Juet 's doing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For weeks he had been saying that Hudson 's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( Sir Francis Drake lopped a man 's head off under similar circumstances ) , Hudson decided to be reasonable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Hudson had finished , the `` town meeting '' broke down into a general , wordy argument .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Up spoke carpenter Staffe , who said he would n't give ten pounds to be home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The statement was effective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The meeting broke up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hudson was free to sail on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450 - mile long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On August 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists - great gateways never before , so far as Hudson knew , seen by Europeans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2000 feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme , for two of his backers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called Hudson Bay ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After three weeks ' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The ship halted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The great `` sea to the westwards '' was a dead end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This must have been Hudson 's blackest discovery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea , but the solid bulk of the North American continent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This was the bitter end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">North and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day after day , week after week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to England through the `` Furious Overfall '' was again filling with ice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once more , Juet 's complaints were the loudest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hudson 's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The trial was held September 10 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hudson , presiding , heard Juet 's defense , then called for testimony from crew members .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hands on Bible , seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The new mate was Robert Bylot , talented but inexperienced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The important result , however , was that Juet and Francis Clemens , the deposed boatswain , became Hudson 's sworn enemies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew 's respect for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once , after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather , Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thomas Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's Bay Company , he purchased great blocks of the Company's stock with the view to controlling its policies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The grant , which stretched southward to Lake Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Seven hundred miles south of York Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By October the little colony about Fort Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Within a few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For many years the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul , Minnesota .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States , its British born employees , now become American citizens - Joseph Rolette , Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly - continued in the fur business .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River , Robert Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1802 Henry referred to `` our new carts '' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In September 1817 at Fort Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie du Chien .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Upon arriving at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams , Secretary of State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois Territories '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie du Chien .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was a three month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With these completed and ice gone from the St. Peter's River ( present-day Minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake , across into Lake Traverse , and down the Red .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk 1040 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie du Chien , until then the most advanced United States post .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the St. Peter's River , the head of navigation on the Mississippi , and began construction of Fort St. Anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , Colonel Josiah Snelling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was from the American outposts that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hercules L. Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk 's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bailly , after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse `` in the Sieux Country '' and reached Fort Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called , late in the fall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He set out on his 700 - mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Observing their distressing condition , Colonel Snelling allowed these half starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alexander McDonnell , governor of Red River , and James Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company , ordered such `` sundry articles '' to a value of 4500 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As the time drew near for the drawing of the British American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina colony - its own post and Fort Daer - was on American territory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Accordingly Selkirk 's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John Halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite Company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis or Prairie du Chien at `` great expense as well as danger '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The disasters of 1825 - 1826 caused more to leave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On June 24 more than 400 families started the three month trip across the plains to the Mississippi .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1837 , 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier in 1840 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its people , including Pierre Bottineau and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier 's mission , St. Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly , from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Accordingly , though the practice violated the no trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company , some settlers went into trade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With their customary source of supply cut off , the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49 th parallel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One wrote : `` [ I am so hungry ] I could eat a rider off his horse + snap at the stirups '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : `` They moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : `` Yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart : `` My girl is none of your one-horse girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She is a regular stub and twister , double geered .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A Yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer :
`` Now I lay me down to sleep , The gray-backs o ' er my body creep ; If they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Charles Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` fall-in '' and the other `` close-up '' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of ' fall-in ' and ' close-up '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels '' ; but a much more common designation was `` the sh-ts '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864 : `` I expect to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross writing , i. e. , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A Yank writing from Vicksburg , May 28 , 1863 , stated `` Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced writing .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But fathers often addressed communications to their small children ; and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of Civil War letters .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners ' families .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote in his diary : `` I strolled among the Alabamans on the right , found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect ' They Recooned as how you ' uns all would be a heap wus to we ' uns all '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a similar vein , but writing from the opposite side , Thomas Taylor , a private in the 6 th Alabama Volunteers , in a letter to his wife , stated : `` You know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe By a set of cowardly Skunks whose Motto is Booty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O ' Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The coalition was to prove inadvisable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">O ' Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone 's body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He carried three guns - one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket - and was equally lethal with both hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; he divided humanity into `` right guys '' and `` wrong guys '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">O ' Banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North Side 's Little Hell , close by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father O ' Brien .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police dodging , and housebreaking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because of this he was known as Gimpy ( but , as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface , never in his presence ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In his teens O ' Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's Cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper 's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary , later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">O ' Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But by now O ' Banion 's political pull was beginning to be effective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $ 10000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle prossed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building ; the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $ 30000 in bribes , it was estimated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As promptly as Torrio , O ' Banion jumped into bootlegging .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians , but he had his huge North Side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unlike the Sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 O ' Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : `` I always deliver my borough as per requirements '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But whose requirements ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Until 1924 O ' Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a question and answer gag that went around at that time : Q. `` Who 'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A. `` O ' Banion , in his pistol pocket '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O ' Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O ' Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was an interesting fraternisation of ex convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It included the top O ' Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O ' Connor , the proprieter of a Loop gambling house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` But when I arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , I knew I had been framed , and withdrew almost at once '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In fact , O ' Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $ 2500 diamond stickpin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a brief interruption while one of O ' Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then O ' Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928 - 29 '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">O ' Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On Election Day - November 4 - he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This further demonstration of O ' Banion 's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self aggrandisement for their liking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado - as , when his bodyguard , Yankee Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler politician in loose beer running league with Torrio and O ' Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To settle this slight , O ' Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">O ' Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A second bullet ricocheted off Max 's belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">O ' Banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre ; he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of Torrio and Capone , was a nonsense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $ 300 to let it through .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the beer runners telephoned O ' Banion - on a line tapped by the detective bureau - and reported the situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">O ' Banion 's reaction was :
`` Three hundred dollars !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To them bums ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why , I can get them knocked off for half that much '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O ' Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But in the meantime the beer runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned Torrio and returned to O ' Banion with the message : `` Say , Dionie , I just been talking to Johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He says he do n't want no trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For three years , since the liquor territorial conference , Torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated O ' Banion 's impudent double-crossing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O ' Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In six months O ' Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once again O ' Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The revenue from O ' Banion 's Cicero territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago 's South and West Sides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O ' Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer concession .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">O ' Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O ' Banion gang 's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $ 100000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition era - the Sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here was stored $ 1000000 worth of bonded whisky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These 1750 cases were carted off in a one night operation by the O ' Banion men , who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 ; it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Whether or not Plato 's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 , 1755 ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic Ocean ; they are far more common in the Pacific .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Hawaiian Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ; one wave swamped more than 1000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27000 people and swept away 10000 homes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest - no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1000 feet in the Pacific .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ; Lagrange 's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a V shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A tsunami is not a single wave but a series .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The waves may keep coming for many hours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was Francis P. Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , one of the world 's foremost marine geologists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On some of the islands ' beaches the waves came in gently ; they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at Pololu Valley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3000 feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander C. K. Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ordinary water tides are disregarded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This in turn sets off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch Harbor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By means of charts showing wave travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All of these activities are geared to a top priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At 17 : 07 that afternoon ( Greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The warning system immediately went into action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake 's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23 : 30 Greenwich time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $ 800000 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The key to the world of geology is change ; nothing remains the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface ; often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there ; and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Today 's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth 's restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth 's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These waves have shown that 1800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( 2 ) If earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book Causes of Catastrophe by L. Don Leet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In Ireland 's County Limerick , near the River Shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen , which means `` Garden of Owen '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The cry `` Garryowen '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes , Sioux and Apaches , Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa , Japanese in the South Pacific , and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7 th U. S. Cavalry Regiment , `` The Fighting Seventh '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern Army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But do n't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh , especially in a saloon on Saturday night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7 th Cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wiry and burr headed , with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The truth is , however , that when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of Troop H , 7 th Cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Outside of combat , he could n't have landed in a tougher spot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all , no unit likes to have a new CO brought in from the outside , especially when he 's an armchair trooper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him , it 's on maneuvers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In combat , helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it 's easy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chandler understood this and expected the worst .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises , beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead Sergeant Early was quiet , sharp and confident .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Further , he had taken full advantage of the Army 's correspondence courses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But for all his erudite confidence , Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That saved Mel Chandler .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sergeant Early let the new CO know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United States Army .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , it was a battalion of the 7 th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It did n't take Captain Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop H .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maneuvers over , the 7 th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo , Captain Chandler still with them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the 7 th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial Palace of the Emperor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But still Mel Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four syllable word , `` Garryowen '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The final proof was a small incident .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It happened at the St. Patrick 's Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The faces belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding , his wife and their two children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And when the singing began , it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about Marvin Goulding , the Jewish officer from Chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no one really thought it was strange .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For Marvin Goulding , like Giovanni Martini , the bugler boy who carried Custer 's last message , or Margarito Lopez , the one-man Army on Leyte , was a Garryowen , through and through .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He set out to keep Troop H the best troop in the best regiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One of his innovations was to see to it that every man - cook and clerk as well as rifleman - qualified with every weapon in the troop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even the mess sergeant , Bill Brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The troop received a new leader , Lieutenant Robert M. Carroll , fresh out of ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth , and he wanted to play it cool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So Mel Chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the Korean war began , on June 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War 2 , , the 7 th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World War 2 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just a month after the Korean War broke out , the 7 th Cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One night on the Naktong River , Mel Chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The troopers knew an attack was coming , but they did n't know when , and they did n't know where .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At 6 o ' clock on the morning of August 12 , they were in doubt no longer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then it came , against Troop H .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with Russian machine guns , attacked the position held by Chandler 's men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They came in waves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First came the cannon fodder , white clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were followed by crack North Korean troops , who mounted one charge after another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They overran the 7 th Cav 's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of their own dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular Army .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Mel Chandler started up the hill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first thing he knew the words `` Garryowen '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">burst from his throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Koreans fell back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was Bob Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They found it at the junction between Troops H and G , and prepared to counterattack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Marvin Goulding saw what was happening .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He turned to his platoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Okay , men '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Follow me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` Garryowen '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">on his lips , his men following .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding fell dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` Garryowen '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">they charged into the enemy like wild men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Goulding 's platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding 's platoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Today he is a major - in the Regular Army .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After years of digging , nights and weekends , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book , Of Garryowen and Glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Take the case of Major Marcus A. Reno , who survived the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">From the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was a member of The Fighting Seventh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7 th Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George S. Patton and Terry de la Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the Civil War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier general at the age of 23 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the U. S. Army .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If they were , Walter Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky , and Herblock would have nothing to draw cartoons about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; and in particular - since this is our special responsibility - that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I speak of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American policy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Peace is a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One was demonstrably false ; the other , for the most part , true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first was that America had become - or was in danger of becoming - a second-rate military power .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment - I certainly do - but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U. S. - Soviet relations for the foreseeable future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might and Soviet Myth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the Soviets ' position : `` There would be more than 2000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Half of the population of the U. S. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev 's nightmarish worries - or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The other charge was that America 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The argument was typically advanced in terms of U. S. `` prestige '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do - namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To the extent , then , that declining U. S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power - of influence , if you will - about which the relevant questions are :
Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded :
the success of Communism 's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences - preferably at the highest level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this may be as far as the process will go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Kremlin 's goal is the isolation and capture , not of Ghana , but of the United States - and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist '' mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign Office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Six years ago French Indochina , though in troubie , was in the Western camp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist ; Laos is teetering between Communism and pro Communist neutralism ; Cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Indonesia , in the early days of the Republic , leaned toward the West .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Today Sukarno 's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists , and for all of its `` neutralist '' pretensions , it is a firm ally of Soviet policy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ceylon has moved from a pro Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the Middle East , Iraq , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin 's foreign policy line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Today , Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Latin America was once an area as `` safe '' for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Today it is up for grabs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One Latin American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In some countries the trend has gone further than others :
Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country - save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged - where Castroism and anti Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only in Europe have our lines remained firm - and there only on the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in England , and even in Germany .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What have we to show by way of counter successes ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have had opportunities - clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did not exist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power :
in Guatemala .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures '' and `` world opinion '' to bring down that Communist government ; we moved decisively to effect an anti Communist coup d ' etat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first rattle of the machine guns , at 7 : 10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sounds exactly like last time '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The middle-aged man said over and over , `` Why did I come here , why did I come here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he was sick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , I heard the thumping of mortars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then the lights went out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was my second day in Vientiane , the administrative capital of Laos , and my thoughts were none too brave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where was my flashlight ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where should I go ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To my room ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A woman with a small boy slipped in between them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Please '' , she said , `` please '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She held out her hand to show that she had money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But what was the story ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Had the Communist led Pathet Lao finally come this far ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Let 's play hero '' , I said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Let 's go to the roof and see '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By 7 : 50 the answer was plain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There had been an eclipse of the moon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A traditional Lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck all around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How quaint it all seemed the next day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And no wonder , for Vientiane , the old City of Sandalwood , had become the City of Bullet Holes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What had been the ambassador 's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9 - 11 , 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Pathet Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` And it 's all the more tragic because it 's so little deserved '' , said Mr. J. J. A. Frans , a Belgian official of the United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U. N. flag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Practically all the people of Laos , he explained - about two million of them - are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They spread over an area no larger than Oregon ; yet they include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` What matters here is family loyalty ; faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits ; and to live in harmony with nature '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Harmony in Laos ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Precisely '' , said Mr. Frans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He spoke of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong River .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even life in harmony with death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To many a Frenchman - they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953 - the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Pathet Lao , stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet Nam , were supplied by Soviet aircraft .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Royal Lao Army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In six years , U. S. aid had amounted to more than $ 1.60 for each American - a total of three hundred million dollars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world 's giants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To find out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the Royal Lao Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist China ( map , page 250 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they did n't crash .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We '' were Bill Garrett of the National Geographic Illustrations Staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met ; Boun My , our interpreter ; and myself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Boun My - the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky - was born in Savannakhet , the Border of Paradise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had attended three universities in the United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane , including the royal capital , Luang Prabang .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Before the airplanes came , he said , travel in Laos was just about impossible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alas , so it almost proved for us , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To go outside the few cities required permits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">and getting them seemed a life 's work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We were told that to the Pathet Lao , a kidnaped American was worth at least $ 750 , a fortune in Laos .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil American intervention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in Vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in French , we were getting nowhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime Minister .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Could we be ready in 15 minutes ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And so , after a flight southeast to Savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak , a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from Texas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From his shoulder bag peeked the seven inch barrel of a Luger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The temperature rose to 105 ` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Keng Kok , the City of Silkworms , the Prime Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was a spleen crushing day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then off again , rushing to keep up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We were miserable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But our two Jeep mates - Keo Viphakone from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver , Pennsylvania - were beaming under their coatings of dust .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Together they had probably done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20 th century - constructively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Keo , once a diplomat in Paris and Washington , was Commissioner of Rural Affairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">John , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London School of Economics , headed the rural development division of USOM , the United States Operations Mission administering U. S. aid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What you see are self-help projects '' , John said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That way they have an infirmary for $ 400 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We have 2500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ask Mr. Keo '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Keo agreed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Our people have been used to accepting things as they found them '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where there was no road , they lived without one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's a big step toward a modern state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You might say we are in the nation building business '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the villages people lined up to give us flowers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Prime Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then we were off again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We did it for three days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But our stumping tour of the south was n't all misery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Crossing the 4000 - foot width of the Mekong at Champassak , on a raft with an outboard motor , we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then we hung overboard in the water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song , on the cool Bolovens Plateau .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood , supported by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the village of Soukhouma , which means `` Peaceful '' , we had a baci .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It takes place in the household , a rite of well wishing for myriad occasions - for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the New Year , for any good purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The preparations were elaborate : flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The candles were lighted , and we sat on split bamboo mats among the village notables .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone 's head , where the worthiest spirits reside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Next he addressed himself to our souls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Those souls like to wander off , and must be called back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We could see maggots moving .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John said : `` I have some antiseptic salve with me , but it 's too late for that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It means that you have to get ahead '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When I pressed for a purely religious definition , I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I like the tradition '' , a girl said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I like to follow the holidays when they come along .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But you do n't have to worship in the traditional way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You can communicate in your own way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As I see it , there 's no real difference between being Jewish , Catholic , or Protestant '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews do n't believe in God , but they believe in people - in helping people '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; it 's to be a good person '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in - 30 per cent ; to get happiness for yourself - 28 per cent ; and financial independence - 21 per cent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews : `` It 's the twentieth century , and they do n't have to wear beards '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers ' minds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We were brought up that way '' was one statement which won general assent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I want to show respect for my parents ' religion '' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since I 'll be living in a suburb '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` When you marry , you want to have things in common '' , a girl said , `` and it 's hard when you do n't marry someone with your own background '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A fourteen year old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities - at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now regard as religious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in addition , required kosher food .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college oriented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sixty five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is substantially higher than the figures for the American population at large - 45.6 per cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This may help explain a phenomenon described by a small town Jewish boy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In their first two years in high school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One of the significant developments in American Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is they who read - and make - Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In upper teen Jewish life , the non college group tends to have a sense of marginality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` People automatically assume that I 'm in college '' , a nineteen year old machinist observed irritably .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , among the girls , there are some morale enhancing compensations for not going to college .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office - in contradistinction to gentile factory workers - and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She is even prone to regard the college girl as immature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New York , Chicago , and Philadelphia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non Jewish world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College - constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session - can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower middle class Jewish student .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is , to begin , an important sex difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Typically , in a lower-middle class Jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are two reasons for this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First , the girl 's education has a lower priority than the son 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Second , the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At the same time , there is a good deal of self congratulation at attending a good college - they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues - and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's people of your own kind '' , a girl remarked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You do n't have to watch what you say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course , I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but I would want lots of Jewish kids there '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For most Brooklyn College students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` As long as I 'm home , I 'll never grow up '' , a nineteen year old boy observed sadly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` They do n't like it if I do anything away from home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's so much trouble , I do n't usually bother '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A freshman girl 's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn College and demanded the `` low-down '' on a boy who was going out with his daughter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Under pressure from parents , the majority of Brooklyn College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans - limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn is gradual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">First , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is significant that the Catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of New York , no longer attracts them in great numbers - except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The great world beyond beckons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places - Fire Island , Nantucket , Westhampton , Long Island , for example - tend to be homogeneously Jewish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior year abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after college rather than during the four school years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory , as much as the Bronx or Central Park West .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are hordes of nubile young women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere - about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Almost everybody in the senior class is married '' , students say dogmatically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the House Plan Association ) that have good news to impart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Witt House happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz of Fife House '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Brooklyn College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Ivy League enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion , or even in nondescript working class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down Ivy way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos - despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel - are not unknown even in early morning classes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having an official drinking place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Fort Lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a few school districts one finds a link between school and job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The `` diversified occupations '' program is a part-time trade preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The `` distributive education '' program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He receives remuneration for his work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Adult education courses , work-study programs of various sorts - these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement - or lack of arrangement - works out quite well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He may or may not be `` better off '' than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">High motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern universities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rather we see here another vicious circle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here again we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated as Negroes in the press .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How can the vicious circle be broken ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both Negro and white , should devote far more attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I should like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect to vocational education .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have been using the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at first sight think it should be used .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of halftime vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of course , it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In spite of the shading of one type of course into another , I believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` I want to be a plumber '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can n't get in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a far distant part of the United States , I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What does he have in mind to do when he graduates '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , he 'll be a plumber '' , came the answer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But is n't it almost impossible to get into the union '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` He 'll have no difficulty '' , I was told .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` He has very good connections '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School in Chicago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hardly a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto mechanics , and airplane mechanics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The physical facilities at Dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; congregational membership , however , is another thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; that is , when it can preserve economic integration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations :
( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes ; ( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The key to Protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive ; they can lose higher - and lower status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman Catholic parish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation - like elements will have to be assimilated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people ; the new people respond in kind by joining the church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless - friendly contacts no longer keep it going .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; the outer life of congregations - the suitability of the environment to their survival - will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; the schism between central city and suburb , Negro and White , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">More than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Negroes , Puerto Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area is self defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron cage of denominational religion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was waiting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They find deep pessimism in them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting for Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But to me Beckett 's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless I was curious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Beckett 's name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett `` hates life '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That , I thought , is at least one thing I can find out when we meet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beckett 's appearance is rough-hewn Irish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The features of his face are distinct , but not fine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One might say it combines the man ; own pride and humility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For he has the pride that comes of self acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the French .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We walked down the Rue de L ' Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world shattering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For one thing , the world that Beckett sees is already shattered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His talk turns to what he calls `` the mess '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The confusion is not my invention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not a mess you can make sense of '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but Beckett did not take to the word truth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What is more true than anything else ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To swim is true , and to sink is true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One is not more true than the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , I do n't know , but their language is too philosophical for me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am not a philosopher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It has held them at bay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` How could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invades our experience at every moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is there and it must be allowed in '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And why not ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How , I asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beckett 's own work is an example .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Plays more highly formalized than `` Waiting for Godot '' , `` Endgame '' , and `` Krapp 's Last Tape '' would be hard to find .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The form and the chaos remain separate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The latter is not reduced to the former .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet , I responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never predictable way ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Is n't all art ambiguous ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not this '' , he said , and gestured toward the Madeleine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory , dominated all the scene where we sat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Boulevard de la Madeleine , the Boulevard Malesherbes , and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the Age of Reason .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is clear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This does not allow the mystery to invade us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With classical art , all is settled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it is different at Chartres .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide ; Hamm 's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is this life death question a part of the chaos ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If there were only darkness , all would be clear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Take Augustine 's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How can we make sense of this division ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In classical drama , such problems do not arise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The destiny of Racine 's Phedre is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As she goes , she herself will be illuminated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is the play .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary - total salvation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The key word in my plays is ' perhaps '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Given a theological lead , I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , really there is none at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have no religious feeling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once I had a religious emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was at my first Communion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My mother was deeply religious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So was my brother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My father had none .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The family was Protestant , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Irish Catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When you pass a church on an Irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , for they deal with distress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some people object to this in my writing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At a party an English intellectual - so-called - asked me why I write always about distress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As if it were perverse to do so !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he thought me more perverse than ever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs :
one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One does not have to look for distress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Perhaps '' stands in place of commitment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; but there is also compassion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a Christian , I know I do not stand where Beckett stands , but I do see much of what he sees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Harold Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting for Godot '' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe 's present politics , ethic , and common way of life '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Waiting for Godot '' sells even better in America than in France .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature '' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not strictly practical ends of culture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">America is now joining Europe in this `` mature '' phase of development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were fences in the old days when we were children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one 's head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred leaf roses ; front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Square corner - and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What one actually remembers is its greenness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit trees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another had ended before it began .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water ; the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Time in the sum is nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And yet - a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one 's being - a certain mental landscape - will seem to have endured without beginning and without end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` It could have been like that for only a little while '' ; but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Once , then - for how many years or how few does not matter - my world was bound round by fences , when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That world was in scale with my own smallness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole - that I could not see - but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown edged holes ; hot colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was mother who planted the verbenas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener :
she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My great grandmother , I have been told , made her garden her great pride ; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar ; she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose tea to drink ; the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ; and the poppies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs ; the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach ; snowballs ; hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside down , make pink petticoated ladies ; and the little , dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite ; seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch ; red and yellow columbines whose round tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them ; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag ; bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made `` gloves '' on the ends of ten waggling fingers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fuzzy caterpillars , snails with their sensitive horns , struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to `` spit tobacco , spit '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dead fledgling birds , their squashed looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the cast shell of a locust , straw colored and transparent , weighing nothing , fragile but entire , with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We collected `` lucky stones '' - all the creamy translucent pebbles , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We showed them to each other and said `` Would you have guessed '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; even when the fences became a part of the game - when a vine embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty 's enchanted castle , or when Rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone ; our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and `` Do n't go outside the gate '' was a command so impossible of misinterpretation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A hay wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If a child watched its progress he whispered , `` Hay , hay , load of hay - make a wish and turn away '' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses ' feet returned no more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster 's cart might turn the corner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sleepily , as if half reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice : `` Rhu-beb ni ice fresh rhu-beb today '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No one seemed to hear him , no one heeded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The horse plodded on , and he repeated his call .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After his passage , the street was empty again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down ; the trees ' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At four o ' clock , or four thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ; he tossed a paper toward every front door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; they were like this fifty odd years ago , and yesterday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the fences were still in place fifty odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ; it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys ' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The `` reality '' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These polar concerns ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi mechanistic powers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The image of God has simply disappeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non artistic causal factors out of which it arises .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The central concern of Erich Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By `` image '' is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one 's good , others threatening ill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one 's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred North Whitehead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whitehead is here questioning David Hume 's understanding of the nature of experience ; he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume 's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">What Hume calls `` sensation '' is what Whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to be sure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were more indications by the mid twentieth century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It 's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' ( as James 's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad I may be , you 're not quite the people to say it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the pre Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there 's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the North than in the South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The line is a pretty good one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">People talk about `` the law of the land '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The expression has become quite a cliche .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But people can n't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to N. V. Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( Francis Thompson 's words for the Hound of Heaven 's pursuit ) by judicial fiat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They did n't seem to be able to think of any .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation - the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . )
.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; it can be changed ; it has been , many times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Justice Taney 's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead letter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast ! )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">and was repealed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Declaration of Independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How do we define it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Calhoun dealt with this question in his `` Disquisition on Government '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">that regional peculiarities do not still exist ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">that the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Circumstances alter cases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico 's history and Mississippi 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the Thank-Heaven-We 're - not-Involved viewpoint , It Does n't Affect Us !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) - especially if they 're rich - often exhibit blithe insouciance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The trouble here is that it 's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You 've already sent your daughter to Miss X 's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y 's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If there 's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there 's always New England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as well as West .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from Thailand , or any place other than the American South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale ; that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I 'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal - North and South - who is not affected personally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">, what voices would be left ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who is involved willy nilly ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well , after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating one 's children into private schools , only the poor folks are left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England , said to me not long ago : `` I can n't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier 's `` Massachusetts to Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English Notebooks '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">and one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Complicity is an embarrassing word .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is something which most of us try to get out from under .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like the cowboy in Stephen Crane 's `` Blue Hotel '' , we run around crying , `` Well , I did n't do anything , did I '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Robert Penn Warren puts it this way in `` Brother to Dragons '' :
`` The recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence '' , where innocence , I think , means about the same thing as redemption .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A man must be able to say , `` Father , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural '' that God `` gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman 's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But did n't they get off too easy ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave owners : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth ; they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Emerson - Platonist , idealist , doctrinaire - sounded a high Transcendental note in his `` Boston Hymn '' , delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause : `` Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who is the owner ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The slave is owner , And ever was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pay him '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like Pilate , they had washed their hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But can one , really ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But that was a long time ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The New England conscience became desensitized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">George W. Cable ( naturalized New Englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise Road , Northampton '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was nice to be able to isolate it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">New England , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the United States .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why should this be so ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is true that New England , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I think that something more than this is involved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Is n't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A + M colleges ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Was it supposed , perchance , that A + M ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post Civil War period , the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Is it not ironical that Roger Williams 's state , Rhode Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The state universities of Maine , New Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A Yale historian , writing a few years ago in The Yale Review , said : `` We in New England have long since segregated our children '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I do n't propose to go into their history , but I have one or two surmises .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On his father 's side he was of German descent , on his mother 's he came of the old Swedish nobility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Va ^ ttern in south central Sweden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden 's ancient glory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in Italy , then in Greece , Egypt , Asia Minor , and Palestine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The Happy Artists '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I scanned the world through printed symbol swart , And through the beggar 's rags I strove to see The inner man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this final line , we have the key to his nature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Few writers have better understood their deepest selves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first result of Heidenstam 's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , Pilgrimage and Wander Years ( Vallfart och vandringsar ) , published in 1888 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did Byron 's Childe Harold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Professor Fredrik Bo ^ o ^ k , Sweden 's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows : `` In this we have the verse of a painter ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ; all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The young poet painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage and Wander-Years is a cycle of short poems , '' Thoughts in Loneliness `` , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` Nameless and Immortal '' , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The man 's true reputation is his work '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` Thoughts in Loneliness '' is , as Professor Bo ^ o ^ k indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It consists of fragmentary personal revelations , such as `` The Spark '' :
`` There is a spark dwells deep within my soul .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To get it out into the daylight 's glow Is my life 's aim both first and last , the whole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It slips away , it burns and tortures me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">That little spark is all the wealth I know , That little spark is my life 's misery '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A dominant motive is the poet 's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : `` Not men folk , but the fields where I would stray , The stones where as a child I used to play '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did not , however , find himself at once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Bo ^ o ^ k describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Bo ^ o ^ k again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Strindberg 's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Heidenstam 's conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whether in prose or poetry , all of Heidenstam 's later work was concerned with Sweden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With the first of a group of historical novels , The Charles Men ( Karolinerna ) , published in 1897 - 8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy 's War and Peace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">About one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles 12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; on the fatal battlefield of Poltava , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The general effect is tragic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Almost nothing is said of Charles ' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The career of Charles 12 , is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon 's was Julius Caesar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Each is still glorified as a national hero .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first half of The Charles Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This comes out in `` When the Bells Ring '' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In `` The King 's Ride '' , Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He finds it in utter misery and desolation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All his people ask for is no more war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had become king at fifteen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , `` A Hero 's Funeral '' , written in the form of an impassioned prose poem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men , and need not detain us here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is different with his volume The Swedes and Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras ho ^ vdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlo ^ f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Especially touching is the chapter , `` The Little Sister '' , about a king 's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The record teems with romance and adventure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gustaf Vasa is a superb example , and Charles 10 , , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12 , it is unnecessary to speak .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; no client would ever think of asking him to do such things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He is , first and foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By virtue of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the same time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In this way , the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; he is a public servant but not a cop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In short , the fictional private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith 's ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the mystery story , as in The Wealth of Nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement :
Adam Smith was wrong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe and the United States dates from the period 1880 - 1900 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19 th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sherlock Holmes , the ancestor of all private eyes , was born during the 1890 s .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus the transformation of Adam Smith 's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private detective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct : he enforces the law without being told to do so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The private eye is therefore a moral man ; but his morality rests upon that of his society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As capitalism in the 20 th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he is good , he may not be legal ; if he is legal , he may not be good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With the advent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes , the development of the modern private detective begins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist ; he is very close to being a mental case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A brief list of the great detective 's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr. Freud with ample food for thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants ; he is prone to semi catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ; he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became a detective in the first place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As he informs Watson , `` My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These little problems help me to do so '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Holmes is a public servant , to be sure ; but the society which he serves bores him to tears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland Yard , Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They for their part are convinced that Holmes is too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why do the police find Holmes `` unorthodox '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have made a magnificent criminal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The great detective modestly agrees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Watson 's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch opponent , Dr. Moriarty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Linked to Holmes even in death , Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the detective , so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the modern English `` whodunnit '' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey ( the respective creations of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers ) have retained Holmes ' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; it is true that they are also extremely dull .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a Sherlock Holmes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The latter 's real descendents were unable to take root in England ; they fled from the Victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy Atlantic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the American `` hardboiled '' detective story of the ' 20 s and ' 30 s , the spirit of the mad genius from Baker Street lives on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like Holmes , the American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His alienation is far more acute than Holmes ' ; he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With Rex Stout 's Nero Wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">More profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler 's Philip Marlowe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a society where everything is for sale , Marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals , always alone , always despised .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ; virtue is its own and only reward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery stories , Dashiell Hammett 's The Maltese Falcon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sam Spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For Sam Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ; moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In either case , they do not appreciate the private detective 's zeal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perry Mason and Hamilton Burger , Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer ; Dashiell Hammett 's Red Harvest provides a classic example of this theme .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is , like Phillip Marlowe , too alienated to be reliable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo , a potential criminal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His successors have adopted the opposite alternative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey Spillane 's Mike Hammer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At first glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For Hammer , nothing is forbidden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge , jury and executioner rolled into one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in Table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example , suppose a man wearing a $ 200 watch , driving a 1959 Rolls Royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` What time is it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host 's desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is received by the ears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This , and other qualifications , make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more than customarily encouraged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The completeness of the connections provide that , for N people , there are * * f lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( 1225 ) for a party of fifty guests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Looking at the diagram , we see that * * f connection lines come in to each member .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the * * f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if N exceeds about six .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers , then the `` open house '' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second - , third - , and fourth hand as a distortable rumor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors , h and e have six , and p has only one , while the remaining points have intermediate numbers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in Figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Location theorists have given these matters much consideration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alexander the Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in Figure 3 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No questions , statements , or explanations are permitted - only commands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even the officer in charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The commands are specified by the military regulations ; are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ; and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( a ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( b ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( c ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of * * f 55987 men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of types of message listed in Table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in Figure 3 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A further regulation is that commands always go down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go up , unaccompanied by commands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore , the network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the like are interlaced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only X-rays , applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites ; or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">American democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the American Democratic Faith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I want to say more about Gabriel 's so-called fundamental law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He terms this early enthusiasm `` Romantic Christianity '' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He says : `` Beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He specifies , `` In the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism , in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But in every period it has been humanism '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And let me add , utopianism , also .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay I called The Leader Follows - Where ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I used his polarity to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call Progressivism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is to say Gabriel 's fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is a weakness of Gabriel 's analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And with Progressivism the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel called Christian supernaturalism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the common man was developing mythic power , or charisma , on his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During the decade that followed , the common man , as that piece put it , grew uncomfortable as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow ( Wilson ) only to learn from Science , to his shocked relief that after all there was no God he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow - that there was a chemical formula for him , and that too much could n't be expected of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What had happened to the common man ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of Popularism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion of Humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the French Revolution 's socialistic offspring of one sort of another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920 s , the dislocations of the Depression , the common ethos of Materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike Fink and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little People .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , it is important to trace the philosophy of the French Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That John Locke 's philosophy of the social contract fathered the American Revolution with its Declaration of Independence , I believe , we generally accept .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet , after Rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the General Will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the French Revolution also .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The importance of Rousseau 's twist has not always been clear to us , however .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This notion of the General Will gave rise to the Commune of Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it is clearly argued by Lord Percy of Newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , The Heresy of Democracy , and in a more general way by Voegelin , in his New Science of Politics , that this same Rousseauan idea , descending through European democracy , is the source of Marx 's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World War 2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And the USSR existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the United Nations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We of the liberal led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During the next five years the leaders of the Fair Deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the New Deal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment - and the bitterest irony - enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon :
the atom bomb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G. O. P. without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower 's leadership .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as The Revolt Of The Moderates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He opens his discourse , however , with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` In essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower 's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling - thus far with but limited and precarious success - to give effective voice and force to that conservatism '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Obviously there has been no agreement on what American conservatism is , or rather , what it should be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I saw a piece the other day assailing William Buckley , author of Man And God At Yale and publisher of the National Review , as no conservative at all , but an old liberal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I would agree with this view .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I 'm not here to define conservatism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle - a struggle that amounts to self redefinition - to see if we can predict its future course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , I suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Though , to be sure , we gave Kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But before I try to diagnose it , I would offer other evidence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by Life magazine , under the title of the National purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The contributors to this testament were all well-known :
a former Democratic candidate for President , a New Deal poet , the magazine 's chief editorial writer , two newspaper columnists , head of a national broadcasting company , a popular Protestant evangelist , etc. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What I want to point out here is that all of them are ex liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I suppose we might classify Billy Graham as an old liberal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And I would further note that they all - with one exception again - sang in one key or another the same song .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its refrain was : `` Let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Adlai Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Others invoked technology and common sense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower 's Commission on National Goals , titled Goals For Americans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American Assembly of Columbia University , because it was non-partisan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what I would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : `` The paramount goal of the United States , set long ago , was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common man 's malaise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And let me add Murray 's new book as another symptom of it , particularly so in view of the attention Time magazine gave it when it came out recently .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Father Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I will reserve discussion of it for a moment , however , to return to President Kennedy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As symptomatic of the common man 's malaise , he is most significant : a liberal and a Catholic , elected by the skin of his teeth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What is the common man 's complaint ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let 's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ralph Gabriel gave it the name of Protestant philosophy of Progress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there 's a subjective side to that utopian outlook .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Noting such evidence is the first step ; and almost the only `` cure '' is early detection and removal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society 's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease '' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We are already committed to establishing man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social political economical context we are fond of today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Naturally this includes all communication forms , e. g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man ; best growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But we cannot start off with a clean slate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man 's major needs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At first glance this appears strange : of all people , was not America founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring `` undeveloped '' societies abroad ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But hear Harrison E. Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The New York Times , and author of `` To Moscow - And Beyond '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a book review of `` The Soviet Cultural Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy and Bess ' overrode the State Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were not diplomats or jazz musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry Ford , Hugh Cooper , Thomas Campbell , the International Harvester Co. , and David W. Griffith .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no more exists in America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In his stead is a milquetoast version known as `` the corporation '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The biggest loss , of course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some forms of capitalism do indeed work - superb organizations , a credit to any society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the pseudo capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing '' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e. g. constructing major airports or dams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject to public control and needs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It can project long-range goals for itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e. g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporations , being more amorphous , cannot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e. g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti democratic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow employees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Any abilities I may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the last years of Woodrow Wilson 's administration , a red scare developed in our country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then , not many years later , the Un-American Activities Committee , under the leadership of Martin Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They give strict interpretation to William James ' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools ; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ; they are the most valuable of commodities - and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away '' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course , there must be clarity : a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But clarity is not enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St. Joseph , Missouri .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An inmate , a former university professor , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We scour literature for them ; here we find stored the wisdom of great minds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But are all these works worthy of consideration ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Can they stand rigid scrutiny ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Shakespeare 's wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But was he infallible in all things ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What of his treatment of the Jew in The Merchant of Venice ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Jews had been banished from England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could learn at second hand from books , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Harris J. Griston , in Shaking The Dust From Shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes : `` There is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Jew was the safest victim .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound of flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars , or even of Tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who cares about them !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an aberrant individual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sets him forth as being typical of the group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He tells of his `` Jewish heart '' - not a Shylockian heart ; but a Jewish heart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no justification for such misrepresentation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If living Jews were unavailable for study , the Bible was at hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Reading the Old Testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to Shylock were abhorrent to the Jews .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are we better off for having Shakespeare 's idea of Shylock ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Studying The Merchant of Venice in high school and college has given many young people their notions about Jews .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Does this help the non-Jew to understand this group ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thomas de Torquemada , Inquisitor-General of the Spanish Inquisition , put many persons to death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Would we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today 's Roman Catholics by saying he had a Catholic heart ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong ; he is out of place in our times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Shakespeare 's Shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is there some magic in it that assures results ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Peter B. Kyne ( Pride of Palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the Japanese , did the heated debates of the Californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Leopard 's Spots came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Long ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap heap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">False ideas surfeit another sector of our life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Helen Deutsch informed us ( The Psychology of Women , Vol.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is questionable , to say the least .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most assuredly ideas are invaluable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the 1930 's , cures for the depression literally flooded Washington .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For a time the President received hundreds of them every day , most of them worthless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The merits of the Salk anti polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But what a super Herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We are reminded , however , that freedom of thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of ideas , is basic under our form of government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Assuredly in our political campaigns there is freedom to think , to examine any and all issues , and to speak without restraint .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No holds are barred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But have the results been heartening ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">May we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In truth , we can say that this broke the power of Senator Joseph McCarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the American people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he had been `` liquidated '' in some way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying point for people who shared his ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Debate in the political arena can be productive of good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it is a clumsy and wasteful process : it can produce negative results but not much that is positive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Debate rid us of McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure ; it did not even provide the architect 's plan for anything new .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By no means would we discourage the production of ideas : they provide raw materials with which to work ; they provide stimulations that lead to further production .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We would establish no censorship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Important as was Mr. O' Donnell 's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors - Nathaniel Hawthorne , for example , and Herman Melville - protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Faulkner 's total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when Mr. O' Donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the South .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Faulkner is a most untraditional traditionalist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Others writing on Faulkner have found the phrase `` traditional moralist '' either inadequate or misleading .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Among them are Frederick J. Hoffman , William Van O'Connor , and Mrs. Olga Vickery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">They have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , I believe , in pointing out Faulkner 's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Faulkner 's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr. O' Donnell implies that it is .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions - or possibly the regulations - governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind - the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is no necessity , I suppose , to assert that Mr. Faulkner is Southern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And , after all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The young William Faulkner in New Orleans in the 1920 's impressed the novelist Hamilton Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written about the South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To believe otherwise would be unrealistic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But in looking at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry James and James Joyce among them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas Nelson Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So Red the Rose , by Stark Young .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis Pendleton Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil War .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Faulkner 's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They have an ancestry extending back , however , at least to 1728 , when William Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back country of Virginia and North Carolina .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil War .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco bound volumes of Horace , Mr. Addison , Mr. Pope , and Sir Walter Scott .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">William Gilmore Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Augustus Baldwin Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Others who wrote of low characters and low life included Thomas Bangs Thorpe , creator of the Big Bear of Arkansas and Tom Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson Jones Hooper , whose character Simon Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will ; and George Washington Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas Bangs Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But Thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble , Arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` The Big Bear of Arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Henrietta 's feeling of identity with Sara Sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that Sara 's epitaph in the Jewish cemetery in Venice referred to her as `` the Sulamite '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama Henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and - especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair - into the relations of men and women : `` In their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts ; usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual ; the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dr. Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century Magazine or Harper 's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The Messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Under her father 's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the Jewish field , but she did begin writing for other Anglo Jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life of Dickens as a spur to her aspiration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns Hopkins University within walking distance of home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district , with only a few professors , but all eminent men , and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In September ' 76 Thomas Huxley , Darwin 's famous disciple , came from England to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the University ; and although it was a school for men only , it afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns Hopkins students , and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on Sunday evenings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From Philadelphia came Cyrus Adler and Joseph Jastrow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Adler , Judge Sulzberger 's nephew , came to study Assyriology .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go far .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Joseph Jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , Marcus Jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His father was a good friend of Rabbi Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for a while .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa , whose mind - although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it - naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Besides , Miss Henrietta - as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so Cyrus Adler became interested in her friend Racie Friedenwald , and Joe Jastrow - the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe - fell in love with pretty sister Rachel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi Jastrow at Rodeph Shalom Temple there during its Rabbi 's absence in Europe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Young Morris , who , while attending the University of Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform movement being promulgated by the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend '' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies '' of Sara Sullam ; and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College - until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` We 've got Father and Mother and each other , '' said Beth on the first page of Louisa Alcott 's Little Women ; and , `` I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world '' , burst out Jo some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the March family , which had first appeared when Henrietta was eight ; and the Szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the Marches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. March , like Benjamin Szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination ; and `` Marmee '' March , like Sophie Szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the Marches had only four to the Szolds ' five .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the March girls had their counterparts in the Szold girls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Henrietta could easily identify herself with Jo March , although Jo was not the eldest sister .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Neither was Henrietta hoydenish like Jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like Henrietta 's , was the feminine form of a boy 's name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But both were high-spirited and vivacious , both had tempers to control , both loved languages , especially English and German , both were good teachers and wrote for publication .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Each was her mother 's assistant and confidante ; and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bertha Szold was more like Meg , the eldest March girl , who `` learned that a woman 's happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of ruling it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bertha , blue-eyed like Mamma , was from the start her mother 's daughter , destined for her mother 's role in life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sadie , like Beth March , suffered ill health - got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart - but that never dampened her spirits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , Sadie learned to write with her left hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments , like `` Oh , What Fun !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A comedy in Three Acts '' , in which , under `` Personages '' , Henrietta appeared as `` A Schoolmarm '' , and Bertha , who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than Henrietta had been , appeared as `` Dummkopf '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sadie studied piano ; played Chopin in the `` Soiree Musicale of Mr. Guthrie 's Pupils '' ; and she recited `` Hector 's Farewell to Andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight of Rabbi Jastrow at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia , where the Szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds ' in Baltimore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls - and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones - there was no particular March counterpart ; but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content - the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; and , as in the March home , any young man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as Papa had first fallen in love with her Mamma before he chose her ; and when a young man like Morris Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns Hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And like Jo March , who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in `` lovering '' before herself , Henrietta saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , Rachel by Joe Jastrow , and Sadie by Max Lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer , begun some years before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled Out of This World , a satire on the Sinatra bobby-soxer craze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The twist lay in using Bing Crosby 's voice on the sound track while leading man Eddie Bracken mouthed the words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , `` Out of This World '' and `` June Comes Around Every Year '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Their first collaboration came close .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled Hot Nocturne .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It purported to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians , their aims , their problems - the tug-of-war between the `` pure '' and the `` commercial '' - and seemed a promising vehicle , for the two men shared a common interest in jazz .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Johnny Mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was born in savannah , Georgia , in 1909 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His father , George A. Mercer , was descended from an honored Southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one Hugh Mercer , who had emigrated from Scotland in 1747 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The lyricist 's father was a lawyer who had branched out into real estate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His second wife , Lillian , was the mother of John H. Mercer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the age of six young Johnny indicated that he had the call .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One day he followed the Irish Jasper Greens , the town band , to a picnic and spent the entire day listening , while his family spent the day looking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But one afternoon Mrs. Mercer met her ; both were obviously on the way to the Mercer home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mother inquired , `` Where 's Johnny , and why did you leave him '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` There was nothing else I could do '' , the maid answered , satisfied with a rather vague explanation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Mrs. Mercer demanded more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The maid then told her , `` Because he fired me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music - though she waited until he was ten - beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Young Mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the Woodberry Forest School , near Orange , Virginia , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he was fifteen John H. Mercer turned out his first song , a jazzy little thing he called `` Sister Susie , Strut Your Stuff '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been , Mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From his playmates in Savannah , Mercer had picked up , along with a soft Southern dialect , traces also of the Gullah dialects of Africa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the summers , while he was still in school , Mercer worked for his father 's firm as a messenger boy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer 's help .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` We 'd give him things to deliver , letters , checks , deeds and things like that '' , remembers his half-brother Walter , still in the real estate business in savannah , `` and learn days later that he 'd absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There they stayed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This rather detached attitude toward life 's encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in Mercer 's personality ever since .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not only has Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp businessman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He has also an extraordinary conscience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In 1927 his father 's business collapsed , and , rather than go bankrupt , Mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He died before he could completely pay off his debts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some years later the bank handling the Mercer liquidation received a check for $ 300000 , enough to clear up the debt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The check had been mailed from Chicago , the envelope bore no return address , and the check was not signed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's Johnny '' , sighed the bank president , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made out the check and carried it around a few days unsigned - in case I lost it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly signed both of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the family business failed , Mercer left school and on his mother 's urging - for she hoped that he would become an actor - he joined a local little theater group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the troupe traveled to New York to participate in a one act play competition - and won - Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Mercer hung on , living , after a fashion , in a Greenwich Village fourth flight walk-up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub '' , his mother discovered when she visited him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` Johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor - he 's always been a good cook - and I 'll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A story , no doubt apocryphal , for Mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monocle in those Village days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monocle and broke it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monocle - and did , over the protests of the former owner - with a square monocle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mercer is supposed to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monocle must be affected '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Everett Miller , then assistant director for the Garrick Gaieties , a Theatre Guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For him Mercer produced the lyric to `` Out of Breath Scared to Death of You '' , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling Holloway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This 1930 edition also had songs in it by Vernon Duke and Ira Gershwin , by E. Y. Harburg and Duke , and by Harry Myers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song writer to take a wife , Elizabeth Meehan , a dancer in the Gaieties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Mercers took up residence in Brooklyn , and Mercer found a regular job in Wall Street `` misplacing stocks and bonds '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">When he heard that Paul Whiteman was looking for singers to replace the Rhythm Boys , Mercer applied and got the job , `` not for my voice , I 'm sure , but because I could write songs and material generally '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While with the Whiteman band Mercer met Jerry Arlen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had yet to meet Harold Arlen , for although they had `` collaborated '' on `` Satan 's Li ' l Lamb '' , Mercer and Harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The lyric , Mercer remembers , was tailored to fit the unusual melody .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mercer 's Whiteman association brought him into contact with Hoagy Carmichael , whose `` Snowball '' Mercer relyriced as `` Lazybones '' , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of Mercer 's song writing career .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After leaving Whiteman , Mercer joined the Benny Goodman band as a vocalist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the help of Ziggy Elman , also in the band , he transformed a traditional Jewish melody into a popular song , `` And the Angels Sing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The countrywide success of `` Lazybones '' and `` And the Angels Sing '' could only lead to Hollywood , where , besides Harold Arlen , Mercer collaborated with Harry Warren , Jimmy Van Heusen , Richard Whiting , Walter Donaldson , Jerome Kern , and Arthur Schwartz .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He may be the only song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U. S. Treasury ; he collaborated on a song with William Hartman Woodin , who was Secretary of the Treasury , 1932 - 33 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen began their collaboration in 1940 , Mercer , like Arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them `` Hooray for Hollywood '' , `` Ride , Tenderfoot , Ride '' , `` Have You Got Any Castles , Baby ? ''</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">, and `` Too Marvelous for Words '' ( all with Richard Whiting ) ; with Harry Warren he did `` The Girl Friend of the Whirling Dervish '' , `` Jeepers Creepers '' , and `` You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mercer 's lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances , a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with the best of them , Mercer 's forte is a highly polished quasi folk wit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in absentia , were an abrupt change from Harburg 's , so that Arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Speaking of his work with Johnny Mercer , Arlen says , `` Our working habits were strange .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked out , we 'd get together for an hour or so every day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While Johnny made himself comfortable on the couch , I 'd play the tunes for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He has a wonderfully retentive memory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After I would finish playing the songs , he 'd just go away without a comment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would n't hear from him for a couple of weeks , then he 'd come around with the completed lyric '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Arlen is one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer Mercer has been able to work with so closely , for they held their meetings in Arlen 's study .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Some guys bothered me '' , Mercer has said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I could n't write with them in the same room with me , but I could with Harold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is probably our most original composer ; he often uses very odd rhythms , which makes it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While Arlen and Mercer collaborated on Hot Nocturne , Mercer worked also with Arthur Schwartz on another film , Navy Blues .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Arlen , too , worked on other projects at the same time with old friend Ted Koehler .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides doing a single song , `` When the Sun Comes Out '' , they worked on the ambitious Americanegro Suite , for voices and piano , as well as songs for films .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Americanegro Suite is in a sense an extension of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection of Negro songs , not for a night club , but for the concert stage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight bar musical strain to which Koehler set the words `` There 'll be no more work / There 'll be no more worry '' , matching the spiritual feeling of the jot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This grew into the song `` Big Time Comin '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By September 1940 the suite had developed into a collection of six songs , `` four spirituals , a dream , and a lullaby '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Negro composer Hall Johnson studied the Americanegro Suite and said of it , `` Of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a Negroid idiom in both words and music , these six songs by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler easily stand far out above the rest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Thoroughly modern in treatment , they are at the same time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average ' Broadway Spirituals ' which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the ' Amen Corner ' , ' judgement day ' , ' Gabriel 's horn ' , and a frustrated devil - with a few random ' Hallelujahs ' thrown in for good measure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One , a reservation on the point I have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo thinking , pseudo feeling , and pseudo willing , which Fromm discussed in The Escape from Freedom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In essence this involves grounding one 's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather than in one 's own values and experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo thinking ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And this , I think , holds for values as well as life styles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One would need to test this proposition carefully ; after all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) Reader 's Digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character I ever met '' deals with village grocers , country doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and so forth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But still , the proposition is worth examination .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right '' and `` wrong '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do not know that this is true ; both Flugel and Ranyard West deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience - most of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of course , to the influence of religion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose , dedication , mission , significance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This , no doubt , is part of what Gilbert Seldes implies when he says of the arts , `` They give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so to speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The terms `` renewal '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal '' of purpose and a `` refreshed '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The notion of `` inspiration '' is somehow cognate to this feeling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message '' , as well as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let us differentiate a few of these ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The Aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , is a persistent and viable one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , Plato 's notion of the arousal of emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts , giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is given some expression in Beardsley 's notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in Housman 's fine phrase on the arts :
they `` transform and beautify our inner nature '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">F. S. C. Northrop , in his discussion of the `` Functions and Future of Poetry '' , suggests this :
`` One of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of common-sense objects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If art is to release us from these postulated things [ things we must think symbolically about ] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these common sense entities '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enriched by it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Richards ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety : for him it constitutes , in part , the organization of impulses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there is one in particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected : `` For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) - then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like '' expressions `` of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here I do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I mean something more like Freud 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In B. M. Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with respect to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden , or by half conscious ideas about the magical power of words ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sensibility is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Among other things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English professor with whom one attends the theatre .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars , political candidates , or female beauty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs , a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I think these attributes cluster , but I have no evidence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The late R. G. Collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote `` We are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue , or even Shakespeare and Titian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and Japanese colour prints ; but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public , of the newspaper critic , and of the creative artist himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Such study may take many forms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The study of ideas in literature is one of these .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He will frequently return to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The continuities , contrasts , and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or critics , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This understanding , of course , may in its turn take many forms and some of these - especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature - are essentially historical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , `` texture '' , or technique .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He may also consider ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At this point a working definition of idea is in order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so to speak `` writ large '' in history of literature where they recur continually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries ; also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in so far as it includes the literatures , must center on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We need not , to be sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">An idea , of the sort that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus Burns 's `` My love is like a red , red rose '' and Hopkins ' `` The thunder-purple sea beach , plumed purple of thunder '' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , Arnold 's `` The unplumbed , salt , estranging sea '' , taken in its context , certainly does so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs to '' some way of thought labelled as a `` school '' or an `` - ism '' , i. e. a complex or `` syndrome '' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus ideas like `` grace '' , `` salvation '' , and `` providence '' cluster together in traditional Christianity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in question , so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` - ism '' or mode of thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Accordingly we may speak of the Platonism peculiar to Shelley 's poems or the type of Stoicism present in Henley 's `` Invictus '' , and we may find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After all , Shelley is no `` orthodox '' or Hellenic Platonist , and even his `` romantic '' Platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Again , Henley 's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like Marcus Aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian , comparable to the patience expressed in Milton 's sonnet on his own blindness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even , to some extent , with science .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian 's research .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let us quote once more from R. G. Collingwood : `` History is properly concerned with the actions of human beings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world ; regarded from the inside , it is the carrying into action of a certain thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The historian 's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is a characteristic of thoughts that , in re-thinking them we come , ipso facto , to understand why they were thought '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` History has this in common with every other science : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in the first place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at the same time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The actual moments of contact are vitally important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the Western world has been that of the Old and New Testament .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , St. Augustine , John Bunyan , and Thomas Jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In much the same way , we recognize the importance of Shakespeare 's familarity with Plutarch and Montaigne , of Shelley 's study of Plato 's dialogues , and of Coleridge 's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling and William Godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English men of letters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">English philosopher Samuel Alexander 's debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting example , as also A. N. Whitehead 's understanding of the English romantics , chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Hegel 's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth century philosophy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our minds grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in Lucretius , who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher Empedocles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here an important caveat is in order .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned , that ideas are `` units '' in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even , for that matter , from one individual to another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , That the Act of July 3 , 1952 ( 66 Stat.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">328 ) as amended ( 42 U.

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The shutter consists of two parts : a fast opening part and a fast closing part .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Using Edgerton 's method , the fast closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fast opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately * * f ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60 - 80 microseconds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and ScH .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as * * f molecules / * * f may be sufficient , as compared to the * * f hydrogen atoms * * f required for detection of the 21 - cm line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ; therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor , which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas ; the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 * * f , with an uncertainty of 0.10 * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Success in observing these spectral lines has so far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and helium 4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement , and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium 4 vapor pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This result is preliminary , and work is continuing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Carbon resistors and impurity doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 * * f at every 0.1 * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree ; and for the third resistor , 3.3 millidegrees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15 - and 25 - liter metallic storage dewars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 * * f but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the | l point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It has also been observed , in helium 2 , , that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Precise pressure volume temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The transducer is a null type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">thick and 1 in.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">in diameter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">apart ( for * * f ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 * * f and at pressures up to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one millimeter of mercury .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A 6 - year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This project was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command , U. S. Air Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from * * f to * * f times normal density .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex - high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There have been a number of sound plans proposed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But none of these has been implemented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here the New York Central Railroad , one of the Nation 's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At this time of crisis in our Nation 's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad 's proposal for control of the Baltimore + Ohio railroads .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The New York Central has pointed out that this control , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission , would give the combined C.+O. - B.+O. Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The New York Central notes : `` The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. + O. - B. + O. provides the backbone of Central 's revenues .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If these services are to be maintained , the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The New York Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is a $ 14 million operation involving 3500 employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A blow to this phase of the Central 's operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself , but to the 40000 people per day who are provided with efficient , reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C. + O. - B. + O. merger scheme '' -
The Central has pointed out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` The logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B. + O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Detailed studies of the plan were well underway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though far from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned , their investors , their customers , their users , and to the public at large .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then , abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. + O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. + O. which resulted in the present situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the light of the facts at hand , however , New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two system eastern railroad structure in the public interest `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Interstate Commerce Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C. + O. - B. + O. merger on June 18 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Obviously , the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is , will it serve the long-range public interest ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter - the two-way B. + O. - C. + O. merger , or the three way New York Central B. + O. - C. + O. merger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New York Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Arthur Hays Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Sulzberger 's successor as publisher is Mr. Orvil E. Dryfoos , who is president of the New York Times Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Dryfoos ' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world 's great newspapers will be maintained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes , a member of the Times staff since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page editor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Oakes succeeds Charles Merz , editor since 1938 , who now becomes editor emeritus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I should like at this time , Mr. Speaker , to pay warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My heartiest congratulations go to their successors , Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes , who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The people of the 17 th District of New York , and I as their Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Speaker , in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U. S. News + World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Under leave to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the U. S. News + World Report :
``
Cuban S. S. R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro held mainland last week , there was at least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian dominated military base .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States , violate the Monroe Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin American republic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For years the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What the next move will be only time , of course , will tell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personally , I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We simply can n't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Obviously , we can n't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Look at Castro now - cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How can the United States act ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Blockade is one answer offered by experts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In it they see a way to isolate Cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish Castro , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is the question now facing President Kennedy :
How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On April 25 , the White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U. S. trade with Cuba was being considered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Its aim : To undermine further Cuba 's economy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">weaken Castro .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another strategy - bolder and tougher - was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It could stop Cuban re export of guns and propaganda materials to South America .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be the most severe reprisal , short of declared war , that the United States could invoke against Castro .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Among these questions :
Military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day 's sailing time away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To round out the blockading force , submarines would be needed - to locate , identify and track approaching vessels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Land based radar would help with this task .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So would radar picket ships .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Three requirements go with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforced without discrimination .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once these conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run to blockade do so at their own risk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Blockade runners can be stopped - by gunfire , if necessary - searched and held , at least temporarily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They could be sent to U. S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Plenty , say the experts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of war strategy to meet short-of war infiltration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At times , three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 , 66 th Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social Security Act in 1935 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78 th Congress in 1943 passed P. L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83 rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 ( P. L. 565 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50 - 50 basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under P. L. 113 , 78 th Congress , the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program , providing for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation - and in addition for short-term training and instruction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first part of the new structure - that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services - is described in this Section .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State 's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per capita income .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It stipulates , in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The term `` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia , and excludes the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The following steps are employed in calculations :
For each State ( except Puerto Rico , Guam , the Virgin Islands , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) determine average per capita income based on the last three years .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Determine the ratio of 50 % to the average per capita income of the U. S. ( Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Determine for each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50 % as the particular State 's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U.

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Determine the particular State 's `` allotment percentage '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By law this is 75 % for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less than 33 - 1 3 % nor more than 75 % .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes , the State 's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Determine if the particular State 's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is greater than its maximum allotment , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Determine if the particular State 's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 - increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $ 23000000 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The funds recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; and second , to increase uniformly the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their maximums , with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the States which maintain two separate agencies - one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind - the Act specifies that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prior to 1960 , in order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a pivot of 40 % State ( or 60 % Federal ) participation in total program costs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State 's `` Federal share '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the States `` unadjusted Federal share '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) 25 % a year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40 % pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50 % and 30 % , respectively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The pre 1960 rate of Federal participation with respect to any State 's base allotment , as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designated by the statute as that State 's `` adjusted Federal Share '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The provisions for determining a State 's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Plans are on pages 22 and 23 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface , making it impractical to build an underground shelter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The space between them is filled with pit-run gravel or earth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The roof shown here ( fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">9 ) is a 6 - inch slab of reinforced concrete , covered with at least 20 inches of pit-run gravel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An alternate roof , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , overlaid with boards and waterproofing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would have to be covered with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The materials for a double wall shelter would cost about $ 700 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Contractors ' charges would be additional .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They form effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth , as shown in figure 10 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Materials for this shelter would cost about $ 700 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A contractor probably would be required to help build it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His charges would be added to the cost of materials .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This shelter , as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An alternate hatchway entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials $ 50 to $ 100 .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $ 1000 to $ 1500 , depending on the type of entrance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The illustration ( fig.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">11 ) shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Plans for the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are shown on pages 26 and 27 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It would add about $ 500 to the total cost of the home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington , D. C. area in the Spring of 1959 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Important considerations common to each type of shelter are :
Arrangement of the entrance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ventilation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Radio reception .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lighting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The entrance must have at least one right-angle turn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Radiation scatters somewhat like light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some will go around a corner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The rest continues in a straight line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore , sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A blower may be installed to increase comfort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A blower is essential for the double wall shelter and for the underground shelters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It should provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Vent pipes also are necessary ( as shown in figs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but filters are not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna , particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lighting is an important consideration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a 4 - cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150 - milliampere flashlight type bulb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tests have shown that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With a spare battery , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other considerations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- If there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In these shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bunks , or materials to build them , may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Forty-nine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Therefore , civil defense instructions received over CONELRAD or by other means should be followed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A battery powered radio is essential .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Radiation instruments suitable for home use are available , and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a possibility that battery powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One instrument thus would serve both purposes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It will tell you as soon as possible :
How long to stay in your shelter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How soon you may go outdoors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How long you may stay outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">You should be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A checklist in the Appendix , ( page 30 ) tells what is needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Families with children will have particular problems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They should provide for simple recreation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Records such as diaries can be kept .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A record should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of broadcast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Family rationing probably will be necessary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Food , medical supplies , utensils , and equipment , if not already stored in the shelter , must be quickly gathered up and carried into it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After the family has settled in the shelter , the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A 10 - gallon garbage can , with a tightly fitting cover , could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A portable electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even if the electric power fails after an attack , any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Warm clothing and bedding , of course , are essential .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Open flame heating or cooking should be avoided .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A flame would use up air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Few areas , if any , are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one tenth of the outside level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If there is time after the warning , the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks , dirt , books , magazines , or other heavy material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In general , such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building , with concrete floors , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Federal Government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential , commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A former du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing du Pont 's share of the General Motors market .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du Pont products were actively promoted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Within a few years various du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors ' eight operating divisions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Fisher Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors outstripping du Pont 's capacity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du Pont by a stock interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The inference is overwhelming that du Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">353 U. S. , at 605 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This Court agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either du Pont or General Motors '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">353 U. S. , at 606 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including du Pont 's competitors '' , 353 U. S. , at 607 , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This claim , as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it , 126 F. Supp .235 , alleged violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman Act allegations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N ] o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about , or in attempting to bring about , the substantial lessening of competition `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The purpose of this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">353 U. S. , at 589 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This , however , did not bar finding that du Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton Act ; that General Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns :
`` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">353 U. S. , at 607 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this : `` The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The District Courts , in the framing of equitable decrees , are clothed ' with large discretion to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case ' .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">353 U. S. , at 607 - 608 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This Court 's judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18 , 1957 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first pretrial conference - held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings - took place on September 25 , 1957 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the outset , the Government 's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Du Pont , he said , had proposed disenfranchisement of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions on the du Pont-General Motors relationship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Government , deeming these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du Pont 's shares of General Motors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Counsel for the Government invited du Pont 's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Counsel for du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No previous antitrust case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25 , 1957 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The plan called for divestiture by du Pont of its 63000000 shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a dividend , over a period of ten years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty + Investment Company , major stockholders in du Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten year period , of du Pont 's General Motors stock allocable to them , as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If , in the trustee 's judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten year period .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition , the right to vote the General Motors stock held by du Pont was to be vested in du Pont 's stockholders , other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General Motors ; du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with General Motors , and vice versa ; and General Motors and du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent rights , or for a grant by General Motors to du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On motion of the amici curiae , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the Government 's plan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On May 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The annual dividends paid to du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du Pont 's earnings and profits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The measure , for federal income tax purposes , of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or du Pont 's tax basis for them , which is approximately $ 2.09 per share .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana , Delaware , and the stockholders of Delaware , and deposited with the trustee , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Du Pont 's counterproposal was filed on May 14 , 1958 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under its plan du Pont would retain its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Christiana and Delaware would , in turn , be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Du Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du Pont could serve as a director of General Motors without court approval .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Du Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On June 6 , 1958 , General Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It argued , inter alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and du Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">General Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as required by the mandate of this Court .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in August of 1958 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These plans , like du Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on du Pont 's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as well as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both plans also prohibited common directors , officers , or employees between du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on the one hand , and General Motors on the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas of the Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U. S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But in any event , I submit that the power to depose belongs to Congress , not to this Court .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I dissent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious objector , was convicted of violating 12 ( a ) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice , he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right to have the hearing officer 's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Held : On the record in this case , the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully complied with ; petitioner was not denied due process ; and his conviction is sustained .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Petitioner was not entitled , either in the administrative hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial , to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , since he was furnished a resume of it , did not challenge its accuracy , and showed no particular need for the original report .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">361 U. S. 899 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We have concluded that petitioner 's claims are controlled by the rationale of gonzales v. United States , 348 U. S. 407 ( 1955 ) , and United States v. Nugent , 346 U. S .1 ( 1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Petitioner registered with Local Board No. 9 , Boulder , Colorado , on March 17 , 1952 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah's Witnesses , employed at night by a sugar producer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He claimed 4 , - D classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On November 13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class 1 , - A .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On November 22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board , protesting this classification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thereafter he was classified 1 , - O .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1 , - A and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella v. United States , 348 U. S. 385 ( 1955 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was again reclassified 1 , - A by the local board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There followed a customary Department of Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In his report to the Attorney General , the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On March 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1 , - A classification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It reported that he now devoted only some 6 - 1 2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good faith '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In his answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering '' was in 1952 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The appeal board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department 's recommendation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This he failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apparently he never took the trouble to find out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board , that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This he did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We found in Gonzales v. United States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut [ the Department 's ] recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">348 U. S. , at 412 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner 's contention , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Estep v. United States , 327 U. S. 114 '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">348 U. S. , at 412 - 413 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At his trial , petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the Department 's hearing officer , Evensen , as well as his report thereon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Section 6 ( j ) of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department 's recommendation to be placed in a registrant 's file .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gonzales v. United States , supra .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer 's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer 's report be placed in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , the hearing officer 's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney General and , of course , is not the recommendation of the Department .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice , of which the Attorney General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Petitioner knew that the Department 's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer 's report and notes at the trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the light of these circumstances , as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department 's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing officer 's report and notes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did receive a resume of it - the same that was furnished the appeal board - and he made no claim of its inaccuracy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even now no such claim is asserted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He bases his present contention on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But this is fully answered by United States v. Nugent , supra .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">346 U. S. , at 5 - 6 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The recommendation of the Department - as well as the decision of the appeal board - was based entirely on the local board file , not on an FBI report .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With this enlarged role in mind , I should like to make a few suggestions : What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We cannot regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure - defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active - this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Assistant Secretaries of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The movement of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There will of course be times for delay and inaction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What I am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas - an affliction of all bureaucracies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome , that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function , regardless of rank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further , I would hope that we could pay attention to little things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To cite only a few examples :
The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City , or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital , can be easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If any official operation abroad begins to go wrong , we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years , in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This means practically everybody in this room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the United Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news item read at the breakfast table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et cetera , ad infinitum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His first thought is about the question itself :
Is there a question here for American foreign policy , and , if so , what is it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is - that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question - tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy oriented conclusions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy , well established precedents , the commitments of the United States under international charters and treaties , basic statutes , and well understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers accumulated in the Department .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He must think about which of these principles must take precedence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole - when the whole is too large to grasp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What is the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If action is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste , at best , and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Should the action be unilateral or multilateral ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For , if so , the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He is interested in public opinion for two reasons :
first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And , given probable public attitudes - about which reasonably good estimates can be made - what action is called for to insure necessary support ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">May I add a caution on this particular point ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the first place our business is foreign policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Truman emphasized this point by saying , `` You fellows in the Department of State do n't know much about domestic politics '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is an important consideration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We cannot test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I doubt , for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The problem in the policy officer 's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors - political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative - to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Strategy and tactics of the U. S. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">- This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level - a year-end strength of 2489000 men and women in the active forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870000 men ; a Navy of 817 active ships and 619000 men ; a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175000 men ; and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825000 men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department of Defense Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">- About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military personnel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Traditionally , rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6 % increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be $ 10.3 billion in 1961 , which is $ 184 million more than in 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour , up 11 % in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15 % .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In total , these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">365 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As I have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Basic long line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air Force , and Federal Aviation Agency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government owned systems in Alaska , and its early enactment is desirable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- Approximately 45 % of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $ 18.9 billion , compared to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $ 4753 million , which is $ 1390 million below that enacted for 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , the new authority of $ 3825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $ 581 million higher than for 1960 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Department of Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known as the Buy American Act .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I urge once again that the Congress not reenact this rider .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some weapons systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , the importance of the Regulus 2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid 1960 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Considering the high cost of the F-108 system - over $ 4 billion for the force that had been planned - and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meanwhile , other air defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high energy fuel program .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high energy fuel program .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and far ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">- The deterrent power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The second capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Strategic Air Command is the principal element of our long range nuclear capability .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 , a long range supersonic bomber .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first Atlas ICBM 's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year , and the first Titan ICBM 's next year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Minuteman solid fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid 1963 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By 1965 , several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system is doubtful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However , I am recommending that development work on the B-70 air-frame and engines be continued .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52 H with the new turbofan engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These additional modern bombers will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers ; one B-52 can do the work of several B-47 's which it will replace .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the Hound Dog air-to-surface missile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas , Titan , and Polaris missiles also will be procured .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For instance , the following statement was rated low in compulsivity , `` She 's naturally quite neat about things , but it does n't bother her at all if her room gets messy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But she cleans it up very well when I remind her '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Castaneda , et al. revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale for use with children .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Taylor Scale was adapted from the Minnesota Multiphastic Personality Inventory , with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Reliability and validation work with the Children 's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda , et al. demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Stanford Achievement Test , Form J , was administered by classroom teachers , consisting of a battery of six sub tests : Paragraph Meaning , Word Meaning , Spelling , Language , Arithmetic Computation , and Arithmetic Reasoning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All of these sub-tests involve reading except Arithmetic Computation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scores are stated in grade equivalents on a national norm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The battery median grade equivalent was used in data analysis in this study .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was administered to each sample third grade child by a clinical worker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a well established fact ( in this case , * * f ) ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over - or under-achievement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I. Q. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example , on the basis of the regression equation , a child with an I. Q. of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 4.8 ( grade equivalent ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If a child with an I. Q. of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement , his discrepancy score would be + .7 , representing .7 of one year of over-achievement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A child with an I. Q. of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 3.5 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If such a child scored 3.0 , his discrepancy score would be - .5 , representing .5 of one year of under-achievement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this manner , the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled , allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of each sub-group graphically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">First of all , as we had surmised , the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better ( * * f ) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools , the high compulsive children do better ( * * f ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported , in this case , at the .05 level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our conjecture is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As predicted , the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( * * f ) than those in the structured schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The interaction effect , which is significant at the .01 level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( * * f ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">According to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sarason et al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Observers , in the two school systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive - and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Roleplaying was offered as a solution - and the procedure worked as follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires , checking their references , interviewing them , asking them to be tried out , he told them he would prefer to test them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each person was to enter the testing room , carrying a suitcase of samples .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the testing room he was to make , successively , three presentations to three different people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the testing room , three of the veteran salesmen served as antagonists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One handled the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a hesitating manner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each was told to purchase material if he felt like it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The antagonists came in , one at a time , and did not see or hear the other presentations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After each presentation , the antagonist wrote his judgment of the salesmen ; and so did the observers consisting of the president , three of his salesmen and a psychologist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This procedure was repeated one day a month for four months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The president of the firm , calculating expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were , in a sense , `` tried out '' in realistic situations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the point of view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one at a time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each girl was independently `` tested '' by the personnel man , and he served not only as the director , but as the antagonist and the observer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist , showing wit , sparkle , and aplomb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An engineer had been made the works manager of a firm , supplanting a retired employee who had been considered outstandingly successful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard worker , was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a `` comer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He seemed to antagonize everyone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Turnover rates of personnel went up , production dropped , and morale was visibly reduced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the insistence of his own supervisor - the president of the firm , he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He played a number of typical situations before observers , other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Entirely concerned with efficiency , he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes , condemning them to too great an extent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did not really listen to others , had little interest in their ideas , and wanted to have his own way - which was the only right way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The entire group of managers explained , in great detail , a number of human relations errors that he made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One by one , these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He admitted his behavior , and defended it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He refused to change his approach , and instead he attacked high and low - the officials for their not backing him , and subordinates for their laxness , stupidity , and stubbornness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After the diagnosing , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life - and refused to change it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We may say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; or we may say that his attitude was commendable , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In any case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a course for supermarket operators , a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager , found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On playing some typical situations before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated as unsatisfactory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was told he displayed , for example , a sense of superiority - and he answered : `` Well , I am supposed to know all the answers , are n't I '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was criticized for his curtness and abruptness - and he answered : `` I am not working to become popular '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior - he answered : `` I have to make decisions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's my job '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In short , as frequently happens in analyses , the individual feels threatened and defends himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How this was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The director helped tailor-make a check list of the district manager 's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences commenting on the mistakes they felt he made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These errors were then collected and written on a blackboard , condensing similar ideas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Eighteen errors were located , and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up , and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No comments were made during the voting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The results looked as follows :
* * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first eight of these eighteen statements , which received at least one-half of the votes , were duplicated to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager , and when this particular manager roleplayed in other situations , the members checked any items that appeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions , they were rather lengthy ( about twenty minutes ) , the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect , new antagonists were brought on the scene unexpectedly , and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously criticized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After every session , the check marks were totaled up and graphed , and in this way the supervisor 's progress was charted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">In life we learn to play our roles and we `` freeze '' into patterns which become so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">We can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To learn what we do is the first step for improvement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To want to change is the third step .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the fourth step .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To use these new ways in daily life is the last step .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When an evaluative situation is set up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This behavior is more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold :
Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone - to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrotlike .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior - which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her - she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At first I did not know what she meant ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Again , I at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then I replied , coldly , `` If you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She looked confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She clearly agreed that this had been the case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing by , between our sessions - for all the world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I have found , time and again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in the final analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For example , one hebephrenic man used to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank you '' to him at the end of each session .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on the one hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others , and on the other hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in short , behaving as if I owned her room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One finds , for example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most unconventional of meanings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More than anything , it is the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck of cards , on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient 's and his months of work together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">one cannot assume , of course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a few , other communicational grooves , as yet - being there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">or an `` I want to go home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A hebephrenic man used to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his largely silent hours with his therapist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill - hello or farewell '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">, the patient replied , `` Both , Dearie - two in one '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression , that which seems best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter - laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated , which now makes one feel like weeping , or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair ; and which , more often than all these , conveys a welter of feelings which could in no way be conveyed by any number of words , words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal like sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from time to time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As I have been intimating , in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; this is a question which I have no wish to take up - condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In my experience , a great many of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Recently , for example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more often than not , entirely unaware .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One hebephrenic women confided to me , `` I live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; Burnham , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning schizophrenic communication , includes mention of similar clinical material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding , in a most articulate fashion , during session after session with me , were like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him ; as he spoke I was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung , high in the air , from a docked steamship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For English the reduction in size is less striking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood :
form - any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">occurrence - an instance of a form in text .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A random storage scheme , based on the spelling of forms , provides an economical way to compile this text form list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally , information is retrieved from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation process - the grammatic description for sentence-structure determination , equivalent choice information for semantic analysis , and target-language equivalents for output construction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dictionary is a form dictionary , at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also , the dictionary is divided into at least two parts :
the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A more detailed description of dictionary operations - text lookup and dictionary modification - give a clearer picture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists of three steps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W region are used for storage of the forms in the text form list ; cells in the X-region and Y region are reserved as information cells for text forms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When an occurrence * * f is isolated during text reading , a random memory address * * f , the address of a cell in the X-region , is computed from the form of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let * * f denote the form of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If cell * * f has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text form list , it is now assigned as the information cell of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region , beginning in cell * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The address * * f and the number of cells required to store the form are written in * * f ; the information cell * * f is saved to represent the text occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Text reading continues with the next occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let us assume that * * f is identical to the form of an occurrence * * f which preceded * * f in the text .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When this situation exists , the address * * f will equal * * f which was produced from * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If * * f was assigned as the information cell for * * f , the routine can detect that * * f is identical to * * f by comparing * * f with the form stored at location * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The address * * f is stored in the cell * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When , as in this case , the two forms match , the address * * f is saved to represent the occurrence * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Text reading continues with the next occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A third situation is possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus , when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If * * f leads to an address * * f that is equal to the address computed from * * f , even though * * f does not match * * f , the chain of information cells is extended from * * f by storing the address of the next available cell in the Y-region , * * f , in * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The cell * * f becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in * * f ; similarly , as many cells are added as are required .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain ; the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hence , when the address * * f is computed from * * f , the cell * * f and all Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether * * f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the information cell for * * f has been determined , it is saved as a representation of * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Text reading continues with the next occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Text reading is terminated when a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text form list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This initiates the second step of glossary lookup - connecting the information cell of forms in the text form list to dictionary forms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text form list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each time a dictionary form matches a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is saved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each dictionary form is looked up in the text form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A random address * * f that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If cell * * f is an information cell , it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to * * f each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If cell * * f is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The list of text forms in the W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and Y-regions are no longer required .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only the assignment of the information cells is important .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The grammatic descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When entries are being retrieved from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This selection rejection process takes place as the file is read .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the W-region .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the complete file has been read , the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region ; the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description of the form it represents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text ordered information cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This leaves the ordering of entries variable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two very useful ways for modifying a form dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatic description of each form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text form list .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When irregularity and variation prevent summarizing , information is written in complete detail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Entries are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long known hymn tunes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley 's hymns are as follows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Dominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the parallel is significant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the answer to what 's wrong now ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">is Bill 's broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement is the predicator has broken , and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking ; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In I know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; in one thing I know it will usually be on the predicator know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; in the double sentence the smaller the town , the friendlier the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In what 's a linguist ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist ; in who 's a linguist ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">it will generally be on the complement a linguist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dominant stress is on her luggage both in that 's her luggage , where her luggage is the complement , and in there 's her luggage , where it is the subject .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Adverbial second complements , however , are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the answer to what was that noise ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">is George put the cat out , dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement , the cat , not the second complement out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the answer to what was that noise ?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">they are likely to lose dominant stress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Context is of extreme importance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Thus in a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here , but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on snows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The personal pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In I 'll go with George dominant stress is probably on George ; but if George has just been mentioned prominently ( and the trip to be made has been under discussion ) , what is said is probably I 'll go with him , and dominant stress is probably on the preposition with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When a gesture accompanies who 's he ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">the personal pronoun has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If both George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context , but the idea of telling George is new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell George ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious , there is normally only light stress or no stress at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its use with snows : nothing can snow snow but `` it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In there are n't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If women replaced people , it would normally have dominant stress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In I have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If work is substituted for things ( with more exact contribution to meaning ) , it will have dominant stress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In I know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In I knew you when you were a child , and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the written language then can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written language simply depends on the reader 's alertness , and a careless reader will have to back up and reread .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus in it 's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In she has it in for George dominant stress will ordinarily be on in , where the notion of stored up antipathy seems to center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In we 're painting at our garage strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Where there is comparison or contrast dominant stresses normally operate to center attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus in his friends are stranger than his sisters ' strong stresses are normal for his and sisters ' , but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In he 's hurting himself more than he 's hurting you both himself and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In is she Chinese or Japanese ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">the desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns of stress of Chinese and Japanese .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus in Mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on Mary marks Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip , strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of Mary 's concerned with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have made speeches , for example ) , and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which Mary wrote accounts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In hunger stimulates man too the situation is very similar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Strong stress on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here again , in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics , but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When a word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part , it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thus when yes , I have is the response to have you finished reading the paper ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the stress on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper , is quite strong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Mack 's the leader at camp , but Jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents is the leader and therefore has stress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mack 's the leader at camp , but Jack 's here , with this is deprived of stress , makes here the complement in the clause .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In of all the suggestions that were made , his was the silliest the possessive his represents his suggestion and is stressed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When go represents itself and a complement ( being equivalent , say , to go to Martinique ) in which boat did Jack go on ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">it has strong stress ; when it represents only itself and on which is its complement ( so that go on is semantically equivalent to board ) , on has stronger stress than go does .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Omission of a subordinator pronoun , however , does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus to has light stress both in that was the conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion I came to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">But when to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that I came to , and similarly in that was the moment I came to , there is much stronger stress on to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In I wanted to tell him , but I was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In to tell him , of course , to is normally unstressed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions that I am to leave this place , dominant stress is ordinarily on leave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions which I am to leave , dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other examples follow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll come by Tuesday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I can n't be happy long without drinking water '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking water is equivalent to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for example , can undermine distinctions such as these .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by any means .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">- Syllables are linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and / or following consonants or combinations of consonants .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Syllables are genuine units , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Doubt on this point is strongest before / l / and / / or / r / .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Historically re is the formative that is employed also in republic , and al is the common suffix .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When ity is added , real clearly has two syllables .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there is every reason to regard deal as a monosyllable , and because of the fact that / l / commonly has the quality of / / when it follows vowel sounds , deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with real .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No single explanation is adequate to account for this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Improvement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The second need is better field techniques .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The great majority of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The result has been neglect , fumbling efforts , or superficial treatment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As these maladies overlap , so must the cure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Good field techniques will not only equip linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Actually , none of these papers says much directly about field techniques .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These things have been disseminated by other means , but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The third need is for better theory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels , but it has not been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Actual practice does not often work out this way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Welmers has suggested one explanation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With tone , individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pitch differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional state to another , may far exceed the small differences between tones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However , any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands ' paper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way ; for example , duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some phonetic features , for example glottal catch or murmur , are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This explanation of tone difficulties , however , does not apply in all languages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In some ( the Ewe type mentioned above ) interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation spans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In many of the syllables , intonation can be safely ignored , and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still , even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A third explanation is suggested by Richardson 's analysis of Sukuma tone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There we see a basically simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While the phonemes can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to morphemic units , i. e. until the morphophonemics is worked out , or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the `` typical tone language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic systems , however , are very different .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consonantal systems are not merely larger , they are multidimensional .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as well , having the opposite effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules is no greater .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse function of the size - smaller systems are more troublesome - for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The statement of the system is a different matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Smaller systems can of course be stated much more succinctly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics - at least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This seems naive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried over from European languages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A. E. Sharp , in Vowel-Length and Syllabicity in Kikuyu , examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the process , he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A few of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He concludes that some changes can made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We need many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One other paper deals with a phonologic problem :
Vowel Harmony in Igbo , by J. Carnochan .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a restatement it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of Igbo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it does not , as it claims , demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The treatment seems unnecessarily loose jointed and complex , largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto Yokuts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; or both .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The differentiation however is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer 's vocabulary is based on Swadesh 's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Swadesh , and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( fox , vulture , salmon , yellow pine , manzanita ) ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The groups are therefore really non comparable in content as well as in size .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Other classes are included only by myself ( interrogatives , adverbs ) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer ( pronouns , demonstratives ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body parts and products , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 terms out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come out with nearly even ratios ; 2.6 and 2.7 ; ( 2 ) Nature ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ( 3 ) adjectives ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios 4.0 versus 3.4 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It will be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This exception may be connected with Hoijer 's use of a much higher percentage of verbs :
22 % of his total list as against 3.5 % in mine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans lingually .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hoijer 's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near synonyms like stomach belly , big large , long far , many much , die dead , say speak ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The totals for these five categories are not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For Athabascan , with a greater range of stems , the first two of five corresponding columns were identical , 1 and 2 stems ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively * * f ; * * f ; and * * f stems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While the particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially arbitrary ; they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material , and they eventuate also in five classes , along a similar scale , containing approximately equal numbers of cases , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in Athabascan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : * * f This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : * * f ; which , divided by * * f gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families , the distance would of course be 0 .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If it were wholly random and unrelated , it would be 2.0 , assuming the five classes were equal in n , which approximately they are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In 1960 , David D. Thomas published Basic Vocabulary in some Mon Khmer Languages AL 2 , no. 3 , pp.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">7 - 11 ) , which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( * * f ) in place of original ( * * f ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards Greater Accuracy ( IJAL 21 : 121 - 137 ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thomas ' findings are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between M-K and I-E .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">and Yok . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">was partially positive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His second conclusion , on semantic word classes , agrees with mine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative frequency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages , 100 % ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and Gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As to relative frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">, Thomas with his ' weighting ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The problem needs further exploration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two Stem Meanings ' , I set off by asterisks those forms in which n of stem B was * * f of stem A 3 , the unasterisked ones standing for * * f ; or under ' Four Stems ' , I set off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems * * f was * * f .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These findings , and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And why that insistence ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not that such a list cannot be constructed ; but the nearer it comes to attaining universality , the less significant will it be linguistically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its terms will tend to be labile or vague , and they will fit actual languages more and more badly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , common-sense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With the universal list as his weapon , Swadesh has extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve millennia back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all Western hemisphere languages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some of this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the farther out he moves , the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the speculative component in his inferences .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He has traversed provinces and kingdoms , but he has not consolidated them behind him , nor does he control them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He has announced results on Hokan , Penutian , Uto-Aztecan , and almost all other American families and phyla , and has diagrammed their degree of interrelation ; but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other than Salish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is his privilege .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The remote , cloudy , possible has values of its own - values of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But there is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics :
the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more remote and elusive external links ; of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in Athabascan , in Yokuts , in Uto-Aztecan in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This involves step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh 's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Title 8 , program of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre employment training for a large number of semi-skilled machine operators .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A few key skilled workers experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While the U. S. Department of Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The U. S. Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Much of the available information comes not from the Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">However , there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Again , one major difficulty is the local focus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many more workers can be expected to respond .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another problem is who will pay for the training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">State governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G. I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This probably would require some support for subsistence as well as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a Youth Conservation Corps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A maximum of $ 600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This would heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative , on-the-job and extension training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wage price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces - no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage price behavior of a few very important industries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2 , .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Part 2 , discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Part 3 , discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Part 4 , is a brief summary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Mathematical Appendix presents the rigorous argument , but is best read after Part 1 , in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross national product .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Price competition is lacking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the purposes of setting the product price , the industry behaves as a single entity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In wage negotiations , the industry bargains as a unit with a single union .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry 's product .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In any given time period , the aggregate demand for the industry 's product is determined by two things : the price charged by the industry , and the level of GNP .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the purposes of this discussion , the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these two variables , since GNP includes other prices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">( We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of GNP .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Because of its importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average cost ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , etc . ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In this model , we abstract from all non wage sources of cost changes , so that the `` public limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In such circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The entry limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in order to `` educate '' the government and the customers of the industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Public indignation and resistance to wage price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3 % per annum than when the increases are on the order of 3 % per month .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The simple passage of an additional eleven months ' time makes the second 3 % boost more acceptable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus , the public limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per se , without an accompanying wage increase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however - only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage price increases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call for less than proportionately larger price increases ( e. g. , if a wage increase of 5 % allows a price increase of 7 % , a wage increase of 10 % allows a price increase of something less than 14 % ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced ( the average cost curve is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The level of this average cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and so forth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The level of average cost ( equal to marginal cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy - its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry , much less to the union or to the public .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be shared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price level increases may offset wage rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , for non negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is this conclusion that we challenge ; we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is convenient to assume that the union industry contract is of one year 's duration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Several factors contributed to this change .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In both respects , international law was Europeanized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the one hand , the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America ( though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine , itself from the outset related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance '' itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A nation such as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin American countries ; out of the question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19 th century scholars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made use of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wheaton stated that the public law was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of course it had always been of European origin in fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now , with virtually every writer , not only was the European origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The European customs on which international law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hall , for example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations into international law ; that is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The difference is important , for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by no means its exclusive domain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The theory of international law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">National identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek 's auto limitation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">According to the new theories , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He no longer sought to find the law ; he made it ; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no law , domestic or international , except that willed by , acknowledged by , or consented to by states .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Related to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industrialization , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The old way of doing things , which depended on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no longer adequate to the task .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First was the period of codification of existing law : the Code Napoleon in France and the peculiar codification that , in fact , resulted from Austin 's restatement and ordering of the Common Law in England .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Codification was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and adjusting the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The legislative mills have been grinding ever since , and when its cumbersome processes were no longer adequate to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another , to the executive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious goals , for embodying the `` public policy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However , the sovereign was not Hobbes ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by no means an immoral or amoral one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Government itself was based upon contract ; business organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , some - Anzilotti is the principle example - went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal norm , Pacta sunt Servanda .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The displacement ( at least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law theory and doctrine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Admiralty law , the law merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law of Nations and made dependent on the several national laws .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Private international law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international law proper , or , as it is often called , public international law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law merchant , and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high seas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well '' - said Mr. Skyros .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I take a little time to think it over '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It was awkward : very awkward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Someone reasonably trustworthy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And Angie would hear about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And Angie knew -
`` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Not too much time , because I 'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And I done favors for you , big favor not so long back , did n't I , and I 'm right here to take on where Pretty left off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I do n't want no trouble , you do n't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr. Skyros '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dear heaven , no , thought Mr. Skyros , turning away as another man came in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; the genial smile seemed painted on his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Angie knew - Speak of dangerous information !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Angie knew too much entirely already .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Big favor I done you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Acourse there 's this deal o ' Denny 's - and Jackie 's - kinda hangin ' fire , ai n't it , maybe you 've been kinda worryin ' over that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And can n't say I blame you '' , said Angie thoughtfully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` This deal with the ace o ' spades .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Anything to do with an ace o ' spades , bad luck '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ace of spades - a widow , that was what they called a widow , these low-class crooks remembered Mr. Skyros distractedly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All about that Angie knew , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When things got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand - it seemed to be a general rule .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All just by chance , and in a way tracing back to poor Frank , all of it , because naturally - brothers , living together - and Angie -
Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo 's regular featured , almost girlishly good-looking face - or indeed anything about Angelo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles ; he found money much more interesting ; but all the same he thought now , uneasily , of the way in which Angelo earned his living - and paid for his own stuff - and eyed the soft smile , and the spaniel like dark eyes , and he felt a little ill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I stay in business so long because I 'm careful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Two weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , then we make a little deal , is n't it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's a long while '' , said Angie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I do n't fool around with it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I go over to Castro and get fixed up there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I can n't wait no two weeks '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And Mr. Skyros did n't like Angie , but what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside , and not likely to come out - And Angie such a valuable salesman , Prettyman said - All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys - Why did everything have to happen at once ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Denny said stupidly , `` Why , you ai n't turning Angie down , are you , Mr. Skyros ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I mean , we all figured - I guess anybody 'd figure - Angie '' -
Angelo gave him an affectionate smile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Mr. Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's O. K. , Denny , everything 's O. K. Ai n't it , Mr. Skyros '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oh , God , the name repeated over and over , anybody to hear - Not being a fool , Mr. Skyros knew why .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held - you could say - the whip hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And all because of Domokous !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If Mr. Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause -
Of course , there was another factor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Angie worth his weight in gold right now , but these users , they sometimes went down fast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Who knew , Angie might not last long .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The sweat broke out on Mr. Skyros ' forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking - hoping - planning - perhaps -
Good God above , had not Domokous been enough ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He patted Angelo 's thin shoulder paternally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now you do n't want to go talking that way '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sure , sure , you 're the one take over for Pretty , soon as I get the supply , get started up again , is n't it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You do n't need worry , Angelo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I tell you , I know how it is with you , my friend , I sympathize , and I 'll make it a special point - a special favor - get in touch , and get some stuff just for you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do n't know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but I 'll try my best , my friend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You see , you got to remember , we all got schedules , like any business !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My man , he won n't be around a little while , he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the Elite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's awkward , you see that , is n't it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , that 's your business , Mr. Skyros '' , said Angie , and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr. Skyros ' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground glass window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I appreciate it , you do that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We do n't none of us want no trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I 'm in a room over the Golden Club on San Pedro , you just ask for me there , you want see me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or maybe I call you - tonight ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">About nine o ' clock , I call and see if you got any .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A couple decks for me , Mr. Skyros - and ten twelve to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , now , I do n't know about that much '' , said Mr. Skyros .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And you know , Angelo , Pretty , he always keeps it a strict cash basis , like they say '' -
`` Sure '' , said Angie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sure , Mr. Skyros .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fifty a throw , that the deal ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I bring you the cash , say five hundred for ten decks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Never mind how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Standard deal , Mr. Skyros .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You go ' n ' have a look round for it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">This is awkward for everybody , is n't it , we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I do my best for you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He got out of there in a hurry , brushing past another man in the door , mopping his brow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The expedient thing - yes , very true , one must make do as one could , in some situations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It could all be straightened out later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not very much later , but when things had settled down a little .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An ace of spades .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was not a superstitious man , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that , indeed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He rather wished he had never got into the business , and still - scarcely to be resisted , a nice little profit with not much work involved , easy money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Katya Roslev , who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now , rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Usually she marked the few who did thank you , you did n't get that kind much in a place like this : and she played a little game with herself , seeing how downright rude she could act to the others , before they 'd take offense , threaten to call the manager .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Funny how seldom they did : used to it , probably .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The kind who came into a cheap store like this !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Grab , snatch , I saw that first !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">and , Here , I 'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I do n't bother with it , see !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This kind of place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She 'd be through here , just no time at all - leave this kind of thing ' way behind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Off at noon , and she 'd never come back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Never have to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Money - a lot of money , enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She 'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills so 's nobody would suspect - maybe could n't get it until Monday account of that , the banks - But that was n't really long to wait .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not when she 'd waited so long already .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No need say anything at all to the old woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had it all planned out , how she 'd do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She 'd say she did n't feel good on Sunday , could n't go to church - there 'd be a little argument , but she could be stubborn - and when the old woman had gone , quick pack the things she 'd need to take , all but the dress she 'd wear Monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a dime .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then on Monday morning - or it might have to be Tuesday - get up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old woman 's purse there in the drawer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would n't be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left , go do the daily shopping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No need leave a note with it , either - or maybe just something like , Do n't worry about me , I 'm going away to make a better life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A better life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Escape .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was n't as if she wanted much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She did n't mind working hard , not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft - all she wanted was a chance , where she was n't marked as what she was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To be Katharine Ross , and work in a nicer shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes , and learn ladies ' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up to now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign sounding names , the ones went to the same church and - Different place , different job , different people , she 'd be all different too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Prettier , she 'd do her hair another way ; smarter , and wear different kinds of clothes - she 'd be Katharine Ross , just what that sounded like .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You 've give me the wrong change '' , said the customer sharply .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Think I can n't count '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Katya made up the amount in indifferent silence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was listening to other voices , out of the future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of those vaguely imagined new , different people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oh , Katharine 's awfully nice , and pretty too , I like Katharine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let 's ask Katharine to go with us , she 's always lots of fun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Katharine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Soon , very soon now & & & .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mendoza did n't wake until nearly nine thirty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was going to be another hot day ; already the thermometer stood close to ninety .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alison was still sound asleep ; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag , and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom , which tasted peculiarly of face powder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today , and drove home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After he 'd got out fresh liver for Bast , he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters , and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Y que sigue despues ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- what then '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">he asked her severely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` A lot of people are so peculiar that they do n't like cats , it 's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens - and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And I suppose now that you 've finally grown up , if a little late , you 'd go on producing kittens every six months or so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yes , well , it 's a pity to spoil your girlish figure - which all those kittens would do anyway - but I think when you 've raised these we 'll just have the vet fix it so there won n't be any more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I wonder if the Carters would take one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it 's no good looking at me like that '' , as she wound affectionately around his ankles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maude 's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Happened to be in the hall !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Happened to hear you quarrel about her !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oh , well , you can n't really blame Lolotte .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She lost her beau to you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But she was talking of Emile when she saw the black line of the open door ; Sarah remembered it clearly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maude went on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've got to get busy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Miss Celie 's taken to her bed , with the door locked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here '' - She thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into Sarah 's hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not that there 's much use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Drink your coffee '' -
Coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's - cold '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't want it '' , Sarah said , firmly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well - I 'll take it down with me as I go '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the door she turned back , her Roman nose looking very long now and satiric .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I forgot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ben and Lucien have gone after them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's just like that book your Northern friend wrote - except there are n't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know Mrs. Stowe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What can they do if they find them '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They can n't do anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's silly , childish , running after them like that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I told Ben so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But of course the paterollers won n't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around , God knows where '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had swished away , she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , pour out the coffee , so no one would drink it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best , cold it was all but undrinkable - especially that cup !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was deeply , horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had quarreled with Lucien , she had resisted his demands for money - and if she died , by the provisions of her marriage contract , Lucien would inherit legally not only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office , but later , when the war was over , her father 's entire estate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She felt cold and hot , sticky and chilly at the same time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now wait a minute , she told herself , think about it ; Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had lost a bottle of opium - but that was on the trip from New Orleans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or someone had taken it during her first day at Honotassa .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yes , she had missed it after her talk with Emile , after dinner , just before Emile was shot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rilly or Glendora had entered her room while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So somebody else could have come in , too - then or later while she was out of the room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to Honotassa with a formed plan to murder her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did n't even know that she was there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he certainly could n't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding - yes , and credible fool he had every right to expect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No , he had been surprised , unpleasantly surprised , but surprised .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then somebody else ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do n't question , Rev had said , do n't invite danger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her skin crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So Lolotte - or anybody - could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That was not reasonable either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The opium had disappeared before Emile 's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah 's own doubts and suspicions - and questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave Honotassa !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That made a certain amount of logic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she would n't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was merely an attempt to frighten her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would n't go back to New York as Maude suggested ; she would n't run like a scared cat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But - well , she 'd be very careful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But before she left her room she dug into her big moire bag , took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So somebody else knew what would happen to her father 's money if she died .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rev had known all along .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rev did n't need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could conceivably have wished to make sure ; Rev loved Honotassa , it was like a part of his breath and body ; Rev had stressed the need for money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rev would never have tried to give her poison !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She thrust the envelope back in the bag ; there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And in all likelihood , by now , there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she 'd been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She went downstairs and received another curious shock , for when Glendora flapped into the dining room in her homemade moccasins , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she had n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Too much work this morning , Miss Sarah - everybody gone like that '' -
Sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , then who brought it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Miss Maude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not much breakfast this morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I do n't know what we 're going to do , Miss Sarah '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 've got to eat '' , Sarah said , curtly , because a chill crawled over her again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maude ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Glendora flapped away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The rice was n't dosed with opium , indeed it had no taste at all , not a grain of salt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway , with the rain dripping from the vines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Get a basket '' , Sarah told her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 'll go to the storehouse '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers , and went with her through the drizzle , to the storehouse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a long , low room , like a root cellar , for it was banked up with soil , and vines had run rampant over that , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was dark but dry and cool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She doled out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried peas , eggs , cornmeal , a little salt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The shelves looked emptier than when Miss Celie had shown her the storeroom , and since the men from the Commissary had called ; there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She took Glendora to the smokehouse , unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon , hanging from the smoke stained rafters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They would n't go hungry , not yet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the fields were green and growing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ca n't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maude had said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She sent Glendora back to the house , her basket and her apron laden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She stood for a moment , rain dripping from the trees over her head , thinking of Maude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah 's room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She could n't see how her death could affect Maude .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She could n't see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New York .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Maude could have shot Emile - if she 'd had a reason to kill him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no use in standing there in the drizzle , trying to find a link between Emile 's murder and opium in a cup of coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She started back for the house , saw a light in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rev , George and Lolotte were mending shoes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">a lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky , drizzling day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were all three bent over a shabby riding boot ; George had a tack hammer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lolotte held a patch of leather , Rev steadied something , a tiny brad , waiting for George 's poised hammer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">George said , `` First thing I do when I get to Vicksburg again , is get me a Yankee '' -
`` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rev looked up and saw her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lolotte looked up and stiffened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">George did n't look up at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at Sarah 's appearance , believing her to be drugged and senseless - and just possibly dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rev said , `` Come in , Sarah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Reckon you know the news '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And what news , Sarah thought as satirically as Maude might have said it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rev 's face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He turned to George and Lolotte .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Take your cobbler 's shop somewhere else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I want to talk to Sarah '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Everything in the office , the spreading circle of lamplight , the patch of leather in Lolotte 's hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">George poised with the tack hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A rush of panic caught Sarah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I mean I 've got to - to see to the kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Glendora '' -
Her words jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in Rev 's face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now why did I do that ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she thought as warm , drizzling rain touched her face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was no schoolgirl , refusing to bear tales .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself ; if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien , her husband .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It might be , indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love , but it was marriage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So she could n't choose Rev as a confidant ; it must be Lucien .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Always provided that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude might have said it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She paused at the kitchen door , caught her breath , told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen , where Glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and Maude was cleaning lamp chimneys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Glendora gave a gulp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Miss Sarah , I can n't cut up no chicken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Miss Maude say she won n't '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Again the homely , everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her - or to murder her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No matter what had happened or had n't happened , somebody had to see about dinner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She eyed the chickens with , if she had known it , something of Glendora 's dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not since last night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I did n't think there was any reason to '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Maybe there is n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Speak to him again anyway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Try talking to some of the fellows he works with , friends , anyone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Try to find out how happy he is with his wife , whether he plays around with women .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You might try looking into his wife too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She might have been talking to some of her friends about her husband if they 've been having any trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You think Black 's the one we 're looking for '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I think he might be '' , Conrad said grimly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Then again he might not '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What a stinking world '' , Rourke said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Black is Gilborn 's best friend '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I know '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Will you be coming back soon '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I think so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'm on my way to see the Jacobs woman '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Gilborn 's secretary ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What for ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You do n't think Gilborn is the - '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't think anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I just do n't want to go off half cocked before picking up Black , that 's all '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Conrad interrupted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Gilborn says he was in his office all day with her yesterday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 'd like to make sure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also , it 's just possible she might know something about Mrs. Gilborn '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll see you later '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Are n't you ever going to go home '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It sure as hell does n't look like it , does it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 'm telling you , if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us to , they 'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench , massaging his right leg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked at his watch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was ten minutes before eleven .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from Lionel Black .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thirty years ' experience let him know , even at this early stage , that Black was his man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he still wanted to know why .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was a cold , windy day , the day after Kitti 's death , but Stanley Gilborn paid no attention to the blustery October wind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After leaving Conrad , Gilborn had no destination .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He simply walked , not noticing where he was , not caring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stopped automatically at the street corners , waiting for the traffic lights to change , unheeding of other people , his coat open and flapping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As he walked , he tried to think .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of Kitti .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mainly of what Conrad had tried to make him believe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was nothing coherent about his thinking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a succession of picture images passing through his mind : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence , in no logical succession .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The enormity of what Conrad had told him made it impossible for Gilborn to accept , with any degree of realism , the actuality of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Conrad 's words had intellectual meaning for him only .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Emotionally , they penetrated him not at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whoever he was and your wife were intimate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gilborn remembered Conrad 's exact words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They made sense and yet they did n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He knew Conrad had told him the truth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet it was n't so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was n't so because it could n't be so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When Kitti was alive - and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm - she had been the center of his life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was the sun , he the closest planet orbiting around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For fifty-five years he had lived , progressing towards a no-goal , eating , working , breathing without plan , without reason .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kitti had come along to justify everything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was his goal , she was his reason .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had lived all his life waiting for her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not once , in the time that he had known her , had he ever considered the possibility , not once , not for one one-thousandth of a second , of her infidelity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He could not consider it now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not really .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And so he walked , aimless again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The walk ended , inevitably , right in front of his hotel building .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The doorman began to nod his head automatically , then remembered who Gilborn was , what had happened to him the night before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked at Gilborn with undisguised curiosity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gilborn passed by him without seeing him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the apartment itself , all was still .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The police were no longer there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no evidence that anything was different than it had been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Except that Kitti was n't there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Without taking off his coat , he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At last , sitting there , in the familiar surroundings , the truth began to sink in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He felt no anger towards Kitti , no sense that she had betrayed him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was all he had , everything he had , everything he wanted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Someone had taken her away from him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger , there is a right-hand one , he remembered from his school days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where there is a victim , there is a killer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whoever he was and your wife were intimate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He rose from the chair , took off his coat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Quickly , he went into the bedroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had lain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gilborn stood there for a long time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He looked at the bed unblinkingly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The bed was empty now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Kitti would lie in it no more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would lie in it no more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with & & & Who ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For thirty minutes , Stanley Gilborn stood there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the end of the half-hour , racking his brains , thinking over and over again of Kitti , her friends , her past , he left the bedroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He could think of no answer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gilborn put on his coat again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before leaving , he took one last , lingering look at the apartment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He knew he would never see it again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the street , walking as quickly as he could , Stanley Gilborn was a lone figure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On Blanche Jacobs , Kitti Gilborn 's death had a quite different effect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For Blanche , Kitti 's death was a source of guilty , but nonetheless soaring , happy hope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In Blanche 's defense , it must be said she was unaware of the newborn hope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If anyone had asked her , she would have described herself only as nervous and worried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She wondered whether Stanley would call .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She wanted to be with him , to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And now she was feeling sick , both from concern about Stanley and hunger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why had n't he called ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Men , she reflected , even men like Stanley , are unpredictable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She tried to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they were n't so many after all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stanley really was quite predictable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That was one of the things she liked about Stanley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was n't like so many other men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The dentist last night , for instance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dinner and the movies had been fine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had taken her upstairs to say good night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had invited him in for coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was in the kitchen , as she was watching the kettle , waiting for the water to boil , that he had grabbed for her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Without warning , without giving her a chance to prepare for it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From behind , he had put his arms on her shoulders , turned her around , and pressed her to him , so close she could n't breathe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Later , she apologized for the long scratch across his face , tried to explain she could n't help herself , that the panic arose in her unwanted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he had n't understood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">When he left , she knew she would never see him again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stanley was n't like that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She could always predict what Stanley was going to do , ever since she first met him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Except for that one morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The morning he walked in to announce to her , blushing , that he was married .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She thought she was going to die .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Blanche could n't remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She thought it was sometime during the second week she worked for Stanley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was nothing that he said or did , but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him , looking forward to his eventual proposal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was thirty-one years old then .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her mother was already considerably concerned over her daughter 's future .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But Blanche had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother 's continued carping , had been able to resist her urgings to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For Blanche , it was only a matter of time before Stanley would propose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was to be expected that Stanley would be shy , slow in taking such a momentous step .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Stanley went along in life , she knew , convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As a result , he never looked for it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But one day , she expected , he would somehow discover , without her having to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; a woman who was willing to give him love , faith , and anything else a woman could give a husband .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed , there was a woman who , unasked , had already given him love .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Unquestionably , Blanche loved Stanley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And then , unexpectedly , Stanley made his announcement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On that first day , Blanche literally thought she was going to die , or , at the very least , go out of her mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker had n't been everything that Blanche was not .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley , taller than Stanley , prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for , much less expect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Kitti could have married a score of men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley Gilborn , there was no need for her to marry Stanley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Kitti had come into the office , on somebody 's recommendation , because she needed help in preparing her income tax return .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Stanley had filled out the return and because , when he was finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely asked Kitti to join him , never expecting her to accept .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Blanche knew all this because the door to Stanley 's office was open and , without straining too hard , she could hear everything that was said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stanley had gone out , saying he would be back in an hour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had n't come back for over two .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After that day , Blanche still did n't know exactly what had happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were mornings when Stanley came in late , afternoons when he left early , days when he did n't come in at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Blanche knew something must be causing Stanley 's new , strange behavior but she never once connected it with Kitti Walker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was too unprecedented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office , Stanley announced he and Kitti were married .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Somehow , Blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That night the two of them left for a week 's honeymoon in Acapulco .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">While they were away Blanche came into the office every morning , running things as she had always run them for Stanley , going through the week in a dazed stupor , getting things done automatically , out of habit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For exactly one week , she was able to continue in this manner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the morning of Stanley 's return , however , her strength left her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Two hours of watching his serenely happy face , listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures , and Blanche had to leave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She stayed away for ten days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mostly , she stayed in bed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She did n't tell anyone , even her mother , what was wrong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She refused to have a doctor , insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His son watched until he got as far as the hall , almost out of sight , then hurried after .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Dad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dad , wait '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He caught up with the old man in the living room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Old man Arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Just this one favor , Dad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just do n't tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Why not '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The old man gave the room a stare in leaving ; under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's the truth '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The Bartlett girl was killed by Mr. Dronk 's son .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Rossi and Ferguson have been across the street , talking to the kid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They 've found some sort of new evidence , a bundle of clothes or something , and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why won n't you accept facts ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The two kids were together a lot , they were having some kind of teen-age affair - God knows how far that had gone - and the kid 's crippled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He limps , and the man who hit you and took the cane , he limped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My God , how much more do you want '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His father looked him over closely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You sound like an old woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You should have gone to work today , ' stead of sneaking around spying on the Dronk house '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Now , see here '' -
`` The trouble with you '' , old man Arthur began , and then checked himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Young Mrs. Arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Is n't enough time to go into it '' , he finished , and slammed the door in his son 's face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Holden turned from the window draperies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They found something else up there '' , she said half aloud to the empty room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They took it away , overalls or something '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She walked restlessly across the room , then back to the windows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now they 've gone , they did n't come back , and they did n't arrest that Dronk boy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She stood frowning and chewing her lip .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She was wearing a brown cotton dress , cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer , a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She smoothed the skirt , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Why on earth did I send him off to work ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was excuse enough to keep him home , that young Mr. Arthur 's still over there '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With sudden energy , she went to the phone and rang Holden 's office and asked for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I think you had better come home '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Mae , we 're so busy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Crosson 's been on everybody 's neck , an order he expected did n't come through and he 's '' -
`` I do n't care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I want you here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 'm all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I need someone to go out and find out what 's happening '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` But I could n't do that , even if I were home '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His voice grew high and trembling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I can n't be underfoot every time those cops turn around !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They 'll think I did something '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He could n't see the grin that split her mouth ; the teeth that shone into the phone were like a shark 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You 'll just have to risk it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You can n't wander along in the dark , can you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 'd think that you , even more than I , would be wondering what they 're up to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They found some clothes '' , she .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Deliberately , she ignored the yelp .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Also , that Mr. Ferguson was here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I guess he wants to ask you some questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I stalled him off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He does n't expect you until five '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Then I 'd better wait until five '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Come home right away '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her eyes were bright with anticipation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In his office , Mr. Holden replaced the phone slowly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He rose from his chair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had to cough then ; he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He got his hat out of the closet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For a moment he thought of going into Crosson 's office to explain that he had to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a pounding in his head , that he decided to let it go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He passed the receptionist in the outer office , muttering , `` I 've got to go out for a little while '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let her call Crosson if she wanted to , let Crosson raise the roof or even can him , he did n't care .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He got into the car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Putting the key into the switch , pressing the accelerator with his foot , putting the car into reverse , seemed vast endeavors almost beyond the ability of his shaking body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once out in the street , the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When he turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home , he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes , sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What on earth was in Mae 's mind , that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What did she think he could do ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He tried to ignore what his own common sense told him , but it was n't possible ; her motives were too blatant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She wanted him to get into trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She wanted the police to notice him , suspect him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was going to keep on scheming , poking , prodding , suggesting , and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And he knew in that moment , with a cold sinking of despair , a dying of old hopes , that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nothing bald , open ; but enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They 'd have some suspicions to repeat to the police .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Though his inner thoughts cringed at it , he forced himself to think back , recreating the scene in which Mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It had n't amounted to anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A second scene flashed before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett girl turning startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Suppose the cops somehow got hold of that ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Well , it had n't been what it seemed , he 'd had no idea the girl was in there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had n't touched her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And when he came to examine the scene , there was a certain staginess to it , it had the smell of planning , and a swift suspicion darted into his mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Too monstrous , of course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mae would n't have plotted a thing like that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was just that little accidents played into her hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like this murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He leaned on the wheel , clutching it , staring into the sunlight , and tried to bring order into his thoughts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He felt light-headed and sick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mae was his wife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was married to him for better or for worse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She would n't be wilfully planning his destruction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But she was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even as the conviction of truth roared through him , shattering his last hope of safety , he was reaching to release the hand brake , to head up the road for home , doing her bidding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He drove , and the road wobbled , familiar scenes crept past on either side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He came to a stretch of old orange groves , the trees dead , some of them uprooted , and then there was an outlying shopping area , and tract houses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he could n't imagine where .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was really no place to go , finally , except home to Mae .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the gate he slowed , looking around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cooper was beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there morosely ; he did n't even look up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man Arthur ; he was straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be waiting to report something .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Holden stepped on the gas .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A new idea drifted in from nowhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He could go to the police .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could tell them his fears of being involved , he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how Mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him - the scene was complete in his mind at the moment , even to his own jerkings and snivelings , and Ferguson 's silent patience .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could throw himself on the mercy of the Police Department .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was n't what Mae would want him to do , though .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was sure of this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once he had abandoned himself to the very worst , once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense , there would n't be very much for Mae to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At that moment , Holden almost slammed on the brakes to go back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson was about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be such a relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What was that old sign , supposed to be painted over a door somewhere , Abandon hope , all ye who enter here ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Why , Holden said to himself , surprised at his own sudden insight , I 'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They 've worried , they 've lain awake nights , they 've shook at the slightest footstep , they 've pictured their own destruction , and now it 's all over and they can give up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sure , they 're giving up hope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Good-bye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Holden waved a hand at the empty street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Glad to see you go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He drove into the paved space before the garage and got out , slamming the car door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked up and down the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If Ferguson 's car had been in sight , Holden would have walked directly to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went to the front door and opened it and looked in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She had a cup of something steaming , coffee perhaps , in one hand , a fresh piece of toast in the other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She stood there , watching Holden come in , and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Mae '' -
`` I 've been thinking '' , she said , swallowing the toast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Did n't you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You used them that time you painted the porch at our other house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And then you wiped up some grease '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had caught him off guard , no preparation , nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Wait a minute .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What do you '' -
`` I 've been looking for them , and they 're gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'm sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or even yesterday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You used to paint in them , and then you just took them for rags .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The police have them now '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't remember any overalls at all '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They were all faded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Worn through at the knees '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She stood sipping and chewing and watching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Green paint , was n't it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well , I 'm not sure of the color .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But you had them '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mae , sit down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Put down the cup of coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell me what this is all about '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She shook her head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She took another bite of toast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Holden noticed almost absently how she chewed , how the whole side of her cheek moved , a slab of fat that extended down into her neck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` My goodness , you ought to remember if I do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 're going to have to go to the police and explain what happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell them the truth , or something , before they come here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A seeping coldness entered Holden 's being ; his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass like , liable to break like an icicle at any moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've never owned any painting overalls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said , `` Is this more like it , Mrs. MacReady ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Or are the eyebrows more like this '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When he had finished with that , he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else , most probably a busboy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Begin to look like him now , would you say ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Different about the mouth , huh ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More like this , maybe '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the Hotel Dumont and blew it off again , and did the same in a tiny , almost airless room in a tenement in the West Forties .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms , sucking dust up once more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Men from the Third Detective District , Eighteenth Precinct , had the longest , the most tedious , job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the Hotel Dumont there had , at the time in issue , been twenty-three overnighters , counting couples as singular .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These included , as one , Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Payne , who had checked in a little after noon the day before , and had not checked out together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Gardner Willings was not included ; he had been at the Dumont for almost a week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was , of course , no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The twenty-three ( or twenty-two with the Paynes themselves omitted ) provided merely a place to start , and their identification was the barest of starts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With names and addresses listed , verification came next .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would take time ; it would , almost inevitably , trouble some water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( `` I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband could n't have been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 's in Boston .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of course he 's in '' - )
The Hotel King Arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The King Arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and did n't want - heaven knew did n't want !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and , at odd hours of night , drive from smaller stations to distant homes , probably through rain or , in November , something worse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The King Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The King Arthur had fifty-four overnighters , again counting rooms rather than people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Check the overnighters out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Failing to find what was wanted , as was most likely , check out other guests , with special - but not exclusive - attention to those with rooms on the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( Anyone active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And know , while all this went on , that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There were other roofs , less convenient but not impossible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is dull business , detecting , and hard on feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was also the one salient question to ask , and ask widely : Did you notice anything out of the way ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Like , for example , a man carrying a twenty-two rifle , probably with a telescopic sight attached ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was , of course , no hope it really would be that simple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The sniper , whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent , would hardly have walked to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder , whistling a marching tune .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Long thin suitcase ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or long fat suitcase , for that matter ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shrugs met that , from room clerks , from bellhops .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who measures ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But nothing , it appeared , long enough to attract attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cases , say , for musical instruments ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">None noted at the Dumont .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Several at the King Arthur .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A combo was staying there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And had been for a week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anything else ?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anything at all strange ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well , a man had tried , at the King Arthur , to register with an ocelot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the Dumont , a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the King Arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged , and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There had also been a man who must have had St. Vitus or something , because he kept jerking his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As reports dribbled in , William Weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mullins came in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no sign of Mrs. Lauren Payne at her house on Nod Road , Ridgefield , Connecticut .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The house was modern , large , on five acres .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Must have cost plenty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The State cops would check from time to time ; pass word when there was word to pass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Weigand tossed this news into the centrifuge .</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sort out the next move .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Try to forget motive for the moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider opportunity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only those actually with Payne when he was shot , or who had left the party within not more than five minutes ( make five arbitrary ) positively had none .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Norths ; Hathaway , Jerry 's publicity director ; Livingston Birdwood , producer of Uprising .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had been with Payne when he was shot , could not therefore have shot him from above .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Take Gardner Willings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had left after the scuffle ; had been seen to leave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Consider him seriously , therefore ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Intangibles entered , then - hunches which felt like facts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Willings would ambush , certainly ; Willings undoubtedly had .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Willings was , presumably , a better than average shot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But - hunch , now - Willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because , if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , tougher , than anything else that went on two legs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Faith Constable had had to `` go on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To be checked out further .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Forget motive ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No , motive is a part of fact .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century old dereliction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Faith Constable had accomplished much in a quarter of a century .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bill shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also , he thought , I doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lauren herself ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had left the party early , pleading a headache .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No lack of opportunity , presuming she had a gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She might , conceivably , have brought one in in a large enough suitcase .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( Check on the Payne luggage . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She might now have taken it away again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Motive - her husband wandering ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bitter , unreasoning jealousy ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But - it happened , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( Call it mentally young ; call it retarded . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was nothing to indicate that Lauren Payne was primitive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She did not move in primitive circles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was young , but not that young .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It occurred to Bill Weigand that he was , on a hunch basis , eliminating a good many .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Masons , mother or son , or mother and son ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Opportunity was obvious .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Motive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here , too , the cause to hate lay well back in the years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But bitterness had more cause to remain , even increasingly to corrode .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With the boy , particularly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The boy had , apparently - if Mrs. MacReady was right in what she had told Mullins - only in recent months been forced to give up college , to work as a busboy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Seeing the man he blamed for this made much of - youth and bitterness and -
Bill picked up the telephone ; got Mullins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Send out a pickup on Mrs. Mason and the boy when you 've got enough to go on '' , Bill said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Right '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mullins would do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A man named Lars Simon , playwright director , had expressed a wish that Anthony Payne drop dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would say , of course , that he had not really had any such wish ; that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say , lightly , meaning nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Which probably would turn out to be true ; which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A man named Blaine Smythe , with `` y '' and `` e '' but pronounced without them , had been fired at Payne 's insistence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was also , if Pam North was right , a closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne 's than she , now , was inclined to admit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He might deny the latter ; would certainly deny any connection between the two things , or any connection of either with murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would have to be given the opportunity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mullins ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was evident that Mullins was the man to go .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was evident that a captain should remain at his desk , directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bill Weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite , and the crack in the plaster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let Mullins keep the firm seat ; let Stein .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stilts and Shadow , on Pam 's bed , appeared to be one cat - rather large , as Siamese cats go , and , to be sure , having two heads and two tails .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , they , or it , seemed to have no legs whatever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pamela North said , `` Hi '' , to her cats , and added that proper cats met their humans at the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of four dark brown ears , one twitched slightly at this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` All right '' , Pam said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I know it is n't dinnertime '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But at this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats , stretching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shadow , the more talkative , began at once to talk , her voice piteous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stilts , a more direct cat , leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward the kitchen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shadow looked surprised , wailed , and trotted after her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The hell it is n't dinnertime , two waving tails told Pam North .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was not , whatever tale was told by tails .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Martha presumably would cope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She might be firm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was most unlikely that she would be firm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They want to be fat cats , Pam thought , and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After a time , it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A vague feeling that Anthony Payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was , in any event , reprehensible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Had Faith Constable 's explanation of her confidence , so uninvited , been a little thin ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That was more like a thought , but not a great deal more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Had that tall dark boy , carrying trays too heavy for him , found what he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more than he could bear ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And possessed himself - how ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">- of a rifle and killed ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pam found she had no answers ; had only a hope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The poor kid - the poor , frail kid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some people have luck and some have no luck and that , whatever people who prefer order say , is the size of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The poor , unlucky -
The telephone rang .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pam realized , to her surprise , that she had been almost dozing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At four o ' clock in the afternoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two martinis for lunch - that was the trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I ought to remember .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do n't pretend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You do remember .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You just - `` Hello ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yes , this is she ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The voice had music in it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even with words coming too fast , they came on the music of the voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I said I would '' , Pam said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They won n't talk about who gave the information .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not unless they have to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They do n't , Mrs. Constable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not unless they have '' -
She was interrupted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Call this a cry for help '' , Faith Constable said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Through a door conveniently unlocked '' , Madden supplemented .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That damn door '' , said the police chief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` A gift horse to be viewed with suspicion '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Madden 's dark face wore a meditative look .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` If there was collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And it makes a very poor red herring for an inside job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Much better to break a cellar window '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Do n't forget , there was the hope it would pass for a natural death '' , Pauling reminded him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Well , with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that would n't be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And a pane of glass is n't hard to '' -
The telephone interrupted him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He scooped up the receiver and said , `` Police chief '' , into the mouthpiece , and then , `` Oh yes , Mr. Benson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was hoping I 'd hear from you today '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened , saying , `` Uh-huh '' and `` I see '' at intervals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At last he said , `` Well , thank you for calling , Mr. Benson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Although there was no doubt in my mind and we 've been handling it as one I 'm glad to have it made official '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He hung up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Coroner '' , he said to Madden .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 's just heard from the pathologist who says Mrs. Meeker apparently died from suffocation '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pauling looked at his notes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Many minute hemorrhages in the lungs ; particles of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scrapings from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No other cause of death apparent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brain examined for thrombosis , clot or hemorrhage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No signs of these , no gross hemorrhage of lungs , heart , brain or stomach '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He paused .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oh , the time of death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The duration of the digestive process varies , the pathologist says , but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that Mrs. Meeker died several hours after her seven o ' clock dinner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Probably around midnight , give or take an hour either way '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pauling paused again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` So there it is '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not your problem , of course , unless Johnston and the murderer are one and the same '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They discussed this possibility .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However likely it was , Pauling said , he could n't limit himself to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had to look for other prospects , other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to Johnston came to light .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Madden , with his investigation centered on the fraud , said that tomorrow he would go to the Bronx bank through which Mrs. Meeker 's checks to Johnston had cleared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Arthur Williams had to be located , they agreed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He might have been in collusion with Johnston on the fraud ; he might be Mrs. Meeker 's murderer or have played some part in her death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was Madden 's suggestion ; the police chief shook his head over it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If Arthur Williams was involved in the fraud or the murder , then he too had another identity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No one the Medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about Johnston .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Scholarship applicant ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pauling looked doubtful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Madden explained that he was thinking of an application sent directly to Mrs. Meeker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he asked to use the phone and called Brian Thayer , who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o ' clock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Madden said that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to Mrs. Meeker 's lawyers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Hohlbein was out for the day , but Mr. Garth would be free at one-thirty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The secretary 's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a concession for which Madden should be duly grateful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had lunch with Pauling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Promptly at one-thirty he entered Hohlbein and Garth 's elegant suite of offices in Medfield 's newest professional building .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He disliked Garth on sight , conservative clothes and haircut , smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties , handclasp too consciously quick and firm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Youngish man on the make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions ; that Mrs. Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; that she was active in the Woman 's Club and he in Lions , Rotary , and Jaycee ; and finally , that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come about if Mrs. Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr. Hohlbein or him about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He asked to see a copy of Mrs. Meeker 's will .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Garth brought one out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The date , October 8 , 1957 , immediately caught the inspector 's eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Fairly recent '' , he remarked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Was she in the habit of making new wills '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh no .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker 's death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her estate had grown considerably .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most ; particularly the scholarship fund .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the time the will was drawn Mr. Hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age , knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Garth hesitated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mr. Hohlbein and I have noticed some lapses since , though .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of them this past year , I 'd say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even two or three years ago I doubt that she 'd have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston affair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She 'd have consulted us , you see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She always did before , and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The inspector nodded , doubting this .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Meeker had n't struck him as ready to seek anyone 's advise , least of all Garth 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With her sharp tongue she 'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Madden settled back to read the will .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He skimmed over the millions that went to Meeker Park , Medfield Hospital , the civic center , the Public Health Nursing Association , the library , and so on , pausing when he came to the scholarship fund .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Two millions were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs. Meeker 's lifetime , and the proviso made that as long as Brian Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees ( hereinafter appointed by the bank administering the estate ) he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would entail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">A splendid vote of confidence in Thayer , Madden reflected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tenure , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Very nice for him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He went on to personal bequests , a list of names largely unknown to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Twenty-five thousand to each of the great-nieces in Oregon ( not much to blood relatives out of millions ) ten thousand to this friend and that , five thousand to another ; to Brian Thayer , the sum of ten thousand dollars ; to the Pecks , ten thousand each ; to Joan Sheldon the conditional bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in Mrs. Meeker 's employ at the time of the latter 's death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( No additional five thousand for each year after Joan 's twenty-first birthday ; Mrs. Meeker had n't got around to taking care of that . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Too bad , Madden thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Joan Sheldon had earned the larger bequest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Hohlbein was left twenty thousand , Garth ten .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were no other names Madden recognized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arthur Williams 's might well have been included , he felt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mrs. Meeker had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death , and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Madden took up this point with Garth , who shrugged it off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Old people have their idiosyncrasies '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Well , she had a number of them where money was concerned '' , Garth said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Sometimes we 'd have trouble persuading her to make tax-exempt charitable contributions , and I 've known her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet ; the next moment she 'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate Johnston affair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was no telling how she 'd react to spending money '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was an annual audit , Garth informed him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No discrepancies or shortages had ever been found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brian Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His salary had reached the ten thousand mark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His expenses ran another four or five thousand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The lawyer did n't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party - Thayer , like himself , Madden reflected , was the extra man so prized by hostesses - and found him easy enough to talk to .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he did n't play golf , did n't seem to belong to any local clubs - his work took him away a lot , of course - which probably accounted for his tendency to keep to himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Garth 's glance began to flicker to his watch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said that he had already told the police chief that he did n't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs. Meeker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would offer no theory to account for her murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The whole thing , his manner conveyed , was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">No doubt Mrs. Meeker had snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even so , Madden 's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be all right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the fraud , with its probable by-product of murder , led to Garth 's door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Motive ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ten-thousand-dollar bequest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">At first glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; but for all his air of affluence , who could tell what his private financial picture was ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The inspector knew as he left that this was wishful thinking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nevertheless , he made a mental note to look into Garth 's financial background .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brian Thayer had a downtown address .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He lived in an apartment house not over three or four years old , a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business district .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He occupied a two bedroom apartment on the fourth floor , using the second bedroom as his office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Airy and bright , the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture , rugs , and draperies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Done by a professional decorator , Madden thought , and somehow as impersonal , as unremarkable as its occupant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In Dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month ; in Medfield , perhaps twenty-five less , not all of it paid by Thayer , who could charge off one room on his expense account .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He took Madden into the room he used as an office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It contained a desk , files , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather armchairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thayer folded it up and offered a drink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The inspector declined .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To begin the interview , he asked if Thayer , with more time to think it over , could add to what he had said the other day about Johnston .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thayer shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's all I think about , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That and her death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 's still unbelievable that it was murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For all her domineering ways , I can n't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Dammit , Phil , are you trying to wreck my career ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because that 's what you 're doing - wrecking it , wrecking it , wrecking it '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Griffith had confronted Hoag on the building 's front steps - Hoag had been permitted no further - and backed him against a wrought-iron railing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His rage had built up as he made his way here from the second floor , helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hoag said , `` I did n't send for you , Leigh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I want the captain in charge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where is he '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Phil , for God 's sake , go away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The undersecretary 's in there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I told you there 's nothing between Midge and me , nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's all in your mind '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A couple of sobs escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why , I 'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Leigh , get a grip on yourself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's not about you or Midge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have some security information about the prime minister '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not about me ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You mean it , Phil ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You would n't pull my leg , old man ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I did get you on the platform this morning '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm not pulling your leg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Will you call that captain '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No use , he won n't come '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He peered closely at Hoag in the gathering darkness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What happened to your head '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I was hit - knocked out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now will you get him '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He says I 'm to take the message '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stared at Hoag drunkenly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Who 'd hit you in the head '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It does n't matter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You get back to the captain and tell him this : Somebody 's going to take a shot at the prime minister , and Mahzeer is in on the plot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with Mahzeer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Griffith said , `` That 's impossible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mahzeer 's the ambassador '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Nevertheless it 's true '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Impossible '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'll show you how wrong you are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mahzeer and the prime minister are alone right now '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He nodded triumphantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` So that proves it '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hoag looked terrified .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where are they '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where 'd you expect , the john ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mahzeer 's office '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where is that '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Facing us , two flights up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Look , old man , you can n't go up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They won n't even let you in the front door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So why do n't you be a good boy and '' -
Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Listen to me , Leigh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you want to spend another day in the State Department - another day - you get in there and tell that captain what I told you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He bit out the words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And you know I can do it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Griffith raised placating hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Easy does it , Phil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was just going .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'm on my way '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the second landing he paused to look for Docherty , did n't see him , and accepted a glass of champagne .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He took several large swallows , recollected that Docherty had gone up another flight , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The way Hoag was , no telling what he might say or do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , what is it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I want Captain Docherty '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Docherty said , `` It 's okay , Bonfiglio , let him by '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They walked toward each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Griffith said , `` Hoag told me to tell you '' - he waited until they were close ; it was hideously embarrassing - `` not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Griffith looked half crocked to the captain ; it would be just like him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Why not '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He claims Mahzeer 's in a plot to kill the P.M . '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Docherty went taut : was it possible ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not possible , he thought ; the prime minister knew who his enemy was here ; he was n't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And if by some wild chance Mahzeer was the man , he would n't dare try anything now - not after Docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One more muddleheaded play like that one and they 'd be leading him away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Still , this had to be checked out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Where 'd your friend Hoag get his information '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Have n't the faintest , Captain '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Would you mind sending him up here ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 'd like to talk to him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Troubled , he continued along the corridor , poking his head into the next office for a careful look around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Hoag had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He was unwilling to rely on Griffith 's carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act on it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If Mahzeer was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while Hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He would have to do something on his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But what ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These were the early departures ; in half an hour the reception would be over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If Mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests ; the scene looked like a Christmas card .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This would be Mahzeer 's office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He and the prime minister would be back from the window , seated at Mahzeer 's desk ; they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; Mahzeer would stand up , the prime minister would follow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mahzeer would direct the prime minister 's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The single shot would come ; Hoag would carry its sound to his grave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mahzeer , of course , would be desolate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hoag turned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where across the street ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where was Muller waiting with the rifle ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Narrow four story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most of them could be eliminated ; Muller 's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The legation was generously set back from the building line ; if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Would the shot come from a roof ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He ran his eye along the roof copings ; almost at once a figure bulked up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With a cop patrolling the road Muller would have to be inside a building - if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La Guardia Airport .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hoag crossed the narrow street , squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From this side he could see farther into the legation 's third story window , but he saw no faces ; the room 's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If only the latter were true .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades : one was a club - that was out ; two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That left three , possibly four , one looking much like the next .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He quickly closed it again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town house , and its owners were in residence ; that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went on to the next building and found what he expected - the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes ; there were six apartments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now what ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This was senseless - he had no idea what to look for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He peered in the boxes themselves ; all were empty except one , and that one was jammed with letters and magazines .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The occupants of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few days , and not likely to return on a Friday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Had Muller made the same deduction ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He opened the inner door ; the cooking odors were stronger - all over the city , at this hour , housewives would be fussing over stoves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He climbed , as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two unbroken flights to the third floor , pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade , all that remained of the building 's beauty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now he was certain : the lock had not yielded to Muller 's collection of keys ; fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It had been shut again , but the lock was broken ; he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What was he to do now ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had thought no further than finding Muller .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He realized now he had more than half hoped he would n't find him - that Muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag 's control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He could not break in on an armed man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Was there time ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hoag pushed open the door : at the far end of the long dark room Muller was faintly silhouetted against the window , the rifle still raised ; he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , dismissing Hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at Hoag 's apartment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch : evil flourishes in the dark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller 's second shot came .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Muller , nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car 's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; his face wore a look of outrage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him lurching heavily from the table .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was dead before his body made contact with the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hoag stumbled back into the hall , leaned against the wall , and started to retch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After Captain Docherty sent Arleigh Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned , buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The safe at Ingleside District Station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to Captain Harris 's office ( to the left ) , the lieutenant 's office ( farther along and to the left ) and the janitor 's supply closet ( straight ahead ) .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries , a hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards , a stack of unsold Policemen's Ball tickets from last year , and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gun set the captain 's fifth of Hiram Walker inside the safe before he reported to Lt. Killpath , though he knew that Killpath 's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on Herman Wolff 's gift .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was more a matter of tact , and also it was none of Killpath 's goddam business .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He walked up to the lieutenant 's office , leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine gun that was occasionally tried out on the Academy Range .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where 's the Lieut '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The clerk wagged his head toward the captain 's office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gun went to the connecting door , which was open , and stood at attention while Orville Torrence Killpath , in full uniform , finished combing his hair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The lieutenant 's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded , and as Killpath raked the comb through it , it stuck together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The lieutenant eyed Gun 's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then glanced back at his own face , moving the comb methodically around his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Leave me alone , Gun thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fight with Sam Schaeffer , fight with the whole damned Bureau .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But leave me alone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because I 'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man , and I 'm going to get him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you just leave me to hell alone , Lieutenant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Killpath peered through half closed lids at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gun waited for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel , though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room , including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Killpath pulled one thin leg up , clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath defying his ulcer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He put his chin on his kneecap , stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block , and stared wordlessly at his sergeant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gun waited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The 7 : 45 bell rang and he could hear the outside doors bang shut , closing in the assembled day watch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Finally , Orville intoned through his hawk nose , `` We can n't have people running in any time they please , Sergeant '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , sir '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Running in , running out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ca n't have it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Makes for confusion and congestion '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He rocked back in the chair , knee locked against stomach , his beady eyes fixed on Matson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was silent again , possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Roll was being called .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gun cleared his throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Killpath said , `` You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago , Sergeant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's not getting all the juice out of the orange , now is it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , sir '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Killpath smiled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gun knew that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The day-watch platoon commander , Lt. Rinker , was calling out the beat assignments , but Matson could n't make the names mean anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I called the station at three this morning '' , Killpath 's nasal voice pronounced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Sergeant Vaughn , sir '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now , now , you 're just guessing , Sergeant '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He smiled thinly , savoring his joke .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What if I said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Sir , Vaughn knows better than to leave the station without a relief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He must have '' -
`` He let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now that 's not regulation , is it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , sir '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But you did n't know a thing about it , did you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Killpath leaned forward ; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again , frowning now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's not taking one 's command with a responsible attitude , Matson '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But stupidity was no consolation when it had rank .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I was out in the district , sir '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So I have heard '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not , ah , limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He took up a white sheet of paper , dark with single-spaced data .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A car pulled into the driveway outside the window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gun knew it was Car 12 , the wagon , returned from delivering Ingleside 's drunk-and-disorderlies to the City Jail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But for some fool reason he could n't remember which men he 'd put on the transfer detail .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He stared at the report in Killpath 's hand , sure it was written by Accacia - just as sure as if he 'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station 's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' - he leaned back and peeled off his glasses `` - failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What have you to say to that , Sergeant '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Killpath sailed the paper across the desk , but Matson did n't pick it up or even glance at it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Well '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I did n't think Accacia knew so many big words , Lieutenant '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Killpath licked his lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Patrolman Accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I do n't think his diligence mitigates your negligence , Matson '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Negligence , hell '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gun held his breath a moment , pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Sir .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to boot , if I 'd sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It 's too bad I did n't call you , and it 's too bad I let Schaeffer use Accacia when he could have had a boy who 'd be glad to learn something of Homicide procedure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I 'm not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people I know in the places they hang around , and '' -
`` Let 's not push our patience beyond the danger line , Sergeant '' , Killpath nasaled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I should n't like to have to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction of duty '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Gun stiffened , his hands balling into fists at his sides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">An argument with Orville Torrence Killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Killpath leaned forward again , rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Let 's just remember , Sergeant , that we must all carry our own umbrella .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A district station can n't run smoothly , unless '' - He interrupted himself , looking around Gun at the doorway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Morning , Lieutenant Rinker '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sorry , Orville .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I thought you had n't come in yet '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've been here for some time '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stood up , cocked his head and eyed Gun coldly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The sergeant is just leaving '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It had come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the showers did n't work , that Loren Severe had thrown up all over the stairs , or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpath 's office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now , as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office , he nodded and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks , not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about Killpath 's little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He just did n't want to talk about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night , Killpath would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour ; because he 'd be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes , remembering then that he 'd left them at the Doughnuttery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He could pick up another pack on his way home , if he were going home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But even before he started across the oiled road to his Plymouth , parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station , he knew that he was n't going home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not yet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It was nine o ' clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turning clods of earth , exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mission Street at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty - the neighborhood that had known Urbano Quintana by day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sol Phillips had purchased the Alliance Furniture Mart seventeen years ago .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will , and the name was written in gold in foot high letters across each of the two display windows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was Gonzalez , Prop. , and under that , Se Habla Espanol .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez , Prop. , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Language was no problem anyway ; Mr. Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Aside from the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising , Mr. Phillips had no worries at all , and he said as much to Gun Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed , mauve velour , $ 79.89 nothing down special !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` She 's honest as the day '' , Mr. Phillips said , and added , `` Mr. Gunnar , I can say this to you : Beebe is a little too honest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You can n't tell a customer how much it 's going to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A time plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' - He interrupted himself , smiling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I put her in lamps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That way I do n't lose so much '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Why do n't you just hire somebody else '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` She says she has to finish a story '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He shrugged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I asked her why she could n't do it tomorrow , but it seems the muse is working good tonight and she 's afraid to let it go '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His name was George Needham and he , too , had come from a good family .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set up , with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich man 's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools and a proper university .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An only child , he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since then he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All this went through Casey 's mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For he had understood that Betty had been engaged to a boy named Barry Jenkins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She had grown up with young Jenkins , and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He wanted to ask her about Jenkins now , but he knew he could n't do so in Needham 's presence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And so , still wondering and a little perplexed , he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Where did you pick him up '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , I 've known him quite a while '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She glanced at her companion fondly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Have n't I , George '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've been after her for years '' , Needham said , `` but I 've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The girl 's eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched Casey 's hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Can I tell you a secret ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We 're going to get married .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do you approve '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Casey kept his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about Needham , who was eight or ten years older than the girl .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He wondered whether Needham was going to swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from Betty 's estate to subsidize him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">None of this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He made a point of frowning , of acting out the part of the fond father confessor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll have to give it some thought '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You would n't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable , would you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She made a face at him and then she laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Of course not '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'll get my references in order '' , Needham said , and though he spoke with a smile , Casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Stop by any time , Casey '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stood up and touched the girl 's arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Come on , darling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you 're really serious about working on that story , I 'd better take you home '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Casey watched them go , still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">As he went out he told Freddie the dinner was perfect , and when he got his hat and coat from Nancy Parks and put a fifty-piece piece in the slot , he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">A taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car , and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours , he did not think to look and see if Jerry Burton 's car was still there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact , he did not think about Jerry Burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only then , when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over Burton , the pillow , the sheet of paper on top of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he was striding across the room , his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jack :
Look in the wastebasket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I knew the only way I could beat you was to play possum , but it was a good try , kid , and I appreciate it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">J. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan , and the instant Casey picked it up he knew what had happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The discarded papers inside were sodden , there was a glint of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He put the basket down distastefully , muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought expanded , the implications jarred him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It no longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And that gun was empty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even before his mind had rounded out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He considered them with brooding eyes , brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He said : `` The crazy fool '' , half aloud .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He put the shells on the table , as though he could no longer bear to hold them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He thought : Where the hell could he have gone ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How can I find him ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room , his imagination out of control .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered up enough to get some sense .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer , whoever he was , in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He thought of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Casey '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tony Calenda '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When he heard Calenda say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">it still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank Ackerly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What picture '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he demanded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You took a picture of me at the corner of Washington and Blake about three thirty this afternoon '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Who says so '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` One of my boys '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Casey believed that much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his `` boys '' close at hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` So '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` With my trial coming up in Federal Court next week I would n't want that picture published '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Who says it 's going to be published '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I would n't even want it to get around '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Under normal circumstances Casey was a little fussy when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Right now , however , he was still too worried about Jerry Burton , and the gun that had no bullets , and the story Burton had told him , to care too much about Tony Calenda .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">His nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Look '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I was hired to take a picture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I took it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's all I know about it and that 's all I care '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` Maybe you 'd better tell the guy who hired you what I said '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You tell him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` All right '' , Calenda said , his voice still quiet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` But I meant what I said , Casey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If that picture gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it , I 'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You do that '' , Casey said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Just be sure to send your two best boys , Tony '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He hung up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found Jerry Burton 's home number .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He called the bar and grill where he had picked Burton up that afternoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When he was told that no one had seen Burton since then , he thought of three other places that were possibilities .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had done all he could and that was that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And anyway Burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He , Casey , had been scared for a while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He should have stayed here and watched Burton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So he made a mistake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So what ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only then did he decide he did n't want one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Casey ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You do n't know me but I know you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For over the years he had received many such calls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of them came from people who identified themselves .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Others because they expected some sort of reward for the information .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony , and , like the police , Casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from Columbus Avenue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements , and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the brakes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did not bother with his radio - there would be time for that later - but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The police car had pulled up behind a small sedan , its headlights still on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Miraculously , she found exactly the right statement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'm well aware that you 've got a pedigree as long as my leg , and that I do n't amount to anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But '' -
`` But it do n't matter a-tall '' , Lord supplied fondly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` To me you 'll always be the girl o ' my dreams , an ' the sweetest flower that grows '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Beaming idiotically , he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She yanked away from him furiously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You shut up !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">shu-tt up-pp !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 've got something to say to you , and by God you 're going to listen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do you hear me ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 're going to listen '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lord nodded agreeably .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said he wanted very much to listen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important , as well as pleasin ' to the ear , and he did n't want to miss a word of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So would she mind speaking a little louder ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I think you stink , Tom Lord !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think you 're mean and hateful and stupid , and - louder '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">said Joyce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Uh-huh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So I can hear you while I 'm checkin ' the car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He opened the door and got out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was n't you goin ' to say somethin '' ' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Then , helpfully , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , `` Maybe you could write it down for me , huh ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Print it in real big letters , an ' I can cipher it out later '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Aah , go on '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Just go the hell on '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He grinned , nodded , and walked around to the front of the car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Lips pursed mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots , peered into the orderly chaos of axle , shock absorber , and spring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went prone on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After a time , he straightened again , brushing the red Permian dust from his hands , slapping it from his six dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five dollar shirt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wore no gun - a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Never , he 'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he really feels that way , she thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's really all he 's got , all he is .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If I could make myself feel the same way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She studied him hopefully , yearningly ; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here in the God-forsaken place , the westerly end of nowhere , Tom Lord looked almost insignificant , almost contemptible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was handsome , with his coal-black hair and eyes , his fine chiseled features .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But she 'd known plenty of handsomer guys , and , conceding his good looks , what was there left ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was n't a big man ; rather on the medium side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Neither was he very powerful of build .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just nothing , she told herself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But , by gosh , I want him and I 'm going to have him !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He caught her eye , came back around the car with the boot wearer 's teetering , half mincing walk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why did these yokels still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He slid in at her side , tucked a cigar into his mouth , and politely proffered one to her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , cut it out , Tom '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she snapped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Ca n't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` This ai n't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Or maybe you just do n't feel like a cigar '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I feel like getting back to town , that 's what I feel like !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now , are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Might get there faster walkin '' ' , Lord drawled , `` seein ' as how I got a busted front spring .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the other hand , howsomever , maybe you would n't either .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I figger it 's probl ' y a sixty-five mile walk , and I c ' n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How - with what ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There 's nothing out here but rattlesnakes '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now , ai n't it the truth '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lord laughed with secret amusement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes , so I reckon I 'll get the boss rattler to help me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tom !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For God 's sake '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Looky '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He pointed , cutting her off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` See that wildcat '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She saw it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat - a test well in unexplored country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And even with her limited knowledge of such things , she knew that the car could be repaired there ; sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , let 's get going '' , she said impatiently .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I '' - She broke off , frowning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Why , I meant what I said '' , Lord declared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` What else would I mean , anyways '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She looked at him , lips compressed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then , with a shrug of pretended indifference , she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In his mood , it was the best way to handle him ; that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum - teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The car lurched along at a snail 's crawl , the left front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Along with this self-satisfaction , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Joyce had seen him like this once before - more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride , field boss for the Highlands Oil + Gas Company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had a legitimate reason for wearing it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was payday for Highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Moreover , as long as the weapon was carried openly , the sheriff 's office had made no previous issue of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` So what 's this all about '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he demanded , when Lord confronted him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'm not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was the wrong thing to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By failing to do as he was told instantly - to take out a permit or return the gun to his car - he had played into Lord 's hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So , `` How about it '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why single me out on this permit deal '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , I 'll tell you about that '' , Lord told him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We aim t ' be see-lective , y ' know ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Do n't like to bother no one unless we have to , which I figger we do , in your case .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">McBride reddened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company , but that had nothing to do with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Look , Lord '' , he said hoarsely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I know you 've got a grudge against me , and maybe I can n't blame you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped ' em do it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But you 're all wrong , man !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'm no lawyer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I just do what I 'm told , and '' -
`` Uh-huh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An ' that could mean trouble with a fella that 's workin ' for crooks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So you get rid of that pistol right now , Mis-ter McBride .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You do that or take you out a permit right now '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">McBride could n't do either , of course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not immediately , as the deputy demanded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oil-field workers were a rough tough lot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How could he exert authority over them - make them toe the line , as he had to - if he knuckled under to this small-town clown ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'll get around to it a little later '' , he mumbled desperately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Just as soon as I go to the bank , and '' -
`` Huh-uh .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now , Mis-ter McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss 's arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was strictly the deputy 's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now , he could only play the last card in what was probably the world 's coldest deck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He flung off Lord 's hand and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , as he doubled , gasping , vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten , Lord straightened him with an uppercut .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A rabbit punch redoubled him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut flattening blow to the stomach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he could n't keep up with them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No more could he defend himself against them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he could no longer think of face-saving , of honor , but only of escape .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why , he 's going to kill me , he thought wildly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I meant him no harm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 've given willful hurt to no man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he 's going to kill me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beat me to death in front of a hundred people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He , McBride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go scot-free , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too energetically .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">McBride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fear maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could n't see ; he was long past the point of coherent thinking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dimly , he heard laughter , hoots of derision , but he could not read the racket properly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He hated them too much to understand - the people of this isolated law unto itself world that was Lord 's world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This , he was sure , was the way they would act ; laughing at a dying man , laughing as a man was beaten to death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And nothing would be done about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nothing unless & & & .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Donna !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Donna , his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Donna was like he was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She lived by the rules , never compromising , never blinded or diverted by circumstance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And Donna would -
When he regained consciousness he was in Lord 's house , in the office of Doctor Lord , the deputy 's deceased father .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Brannon outfit - known as the Slash-B because of its brand - reached Hondo Creek before sundown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night 's bedground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two of the new hands , a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , rolled and lighted brown paper cigarettes , lounged about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was some idle talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious :
the failure of the boss 's wife and son to join the outfit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It especially bothered the older hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cook , Mateo Garcia , had arrived there long before the herd .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 'd started a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Supper would be ready within the hour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon 's and his father 's wagon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it , which had been at midday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 'd come alone , without his wife and child .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 'd been in an angry mood : Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She wondered what had taken place in town , between him and his wife .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She wished that she could talk to her mother about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Pat , get out of that creek !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You too , Sean !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Elena , you 'll get mud all over your dress '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Even as she called to the children , Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tomas , she called him - as the Mexican hands did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , Luis Hernandez .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whatever they are talking about ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Conchita wondered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It bothered her that she probably would never know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Certainly , she would n't dare ask her father afterward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would tell her not to pry into grownups ' affairs - as though she were a little kid like Elena !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were sitting on their heels , rider fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He held a cigarette in his right hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was burning away , forgotten .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His face was clouded with unhappiness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He 'd told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife 's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally Hernandez said , `` I could offer you advice , Tomas , but you would n't heed it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Let 's hear it , anyway '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Wait a little while .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let Senora Brannon live in her father 's house for a time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Give her time to miss you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe she will then come to you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After all , you want the senora as much as you want the boy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You need her even more than you need him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` She won n't change her mind '' , Brannon said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` John Clayton will see to that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But after a time away from you & & & '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` A year , Luis ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Five ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ten ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How long should I wait '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Maybe in a year , Tomas & & & '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` In a year she 'll like living in Clayton 's house too much to come back to me '' , Brannon said flatly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` And the boy will be too much under his influence by then .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I 've got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me - his own father '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` In my place , you 'd follow such advice as you give me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That I can n't answer , for I can n't imagine something like this happening to me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maybe I should withdraw my advice - no '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Brannon looked at Hank Maguire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What would you do in my place '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hank shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know , Tom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Like Luis , I can n't see something like this happening to me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With Maria and me , there 's never any problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where I go , she goes - and the kids with us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You 're going to need your woman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the boy will need his mother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you take the one , you 'd better take both '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brannon shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I won n't force Beth to come against her will .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I 'm going to have my son '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were silent for a little while , each looking glum .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Finally Luis Hernandez said , `` What must be , must be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am with you , of course , Tomas '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And Hank Maguire added , `` So am I , Tom '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` All right '' , Brannon said , rising .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 'll ride out as soon as we 've had chuck '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During much of the fifteen mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Later , they 'd heard the rumble of thunder and then , just outside Rockfork , they ran into rain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Those who had slickers donned them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The others put on old coats or ducking jackets , whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were seven of them , enough for a show of strength - to run a bluff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was to be nothing more than that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was to be no gunplay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the bluff failed and they ran into trouble , Brannon had told the others , they would withdraw - and he would come after his son another time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did n't want to put himself outside the law .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With him were Hank Maguire , Luis Hernandez , and Luis 's son Pedro .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Ramirez brothers were also along .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The seventh man was Red Hogan , a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell raising .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were all good men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was dark early , because of the storm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also because of the storm , the streets of Rockfork were deserted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lighted windows glowed jewel bright through the downpour .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They reined in before the town marshal 's office , a box sized building on Main Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A lamp burned inside , but Brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He 'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Probably just stepped out '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Maybe to have supper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Red , come along .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The rest of you wait here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With Red Hogan , he rode to the Welcome Cafe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Maybe he 's at the hotel '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They rode to the Rockfork House , a little farther along the opposite side of the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They reined in there , Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brannon had no slicker .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He 'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he felt no physical discomfort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hardly noticed the blue green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hogan reappeared , stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 's finished eating '' , Hogan said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sitting with a cup of coffee now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It should n't be long '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It seemed long , at least to Tom Brannon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He and Hogan waited by the door , one to either side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Macklin was the third man to come out , and he came unhurriedly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was puffing on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and then it was too late .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Just come along '' , Brannon told him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't start anything you can n't finish '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now , listen '' - Macklin began .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 'll talk over at your office '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Brannon , I warn you '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Let 's go , Marsh al '' , Brannon said , and took him by the arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hogan gripped the lawman 's other arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The other five Slash-B men followed them inside , crowding the small room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He looked at each of them in turn , Brannon last of all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll remember you '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Every last one of you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As for you , Brannon '' -
`` Put your gun on the desk , Marshal '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Now , hold on , damn it ; I won n't '' -
Red Hogan 's patience ran out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He lifted the skirt of Macklin 's coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Too much fooling around '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't press your luck , badge toter '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brannon said , `` Now the key to the lockup , Marshal '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Key '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Macklin said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What for '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ca n't you guess '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brannon said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` We 're putting you where you won n't come to harm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Come on - the key .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Get it out '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Damned if I will .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brannon , you 've assaulted a law officer and '' -
They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His face took on a sudden pallor , became beaded with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He held out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He swore , and said , `` All right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's here in my pocket '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Get it out '' , Brannon ordered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , as Macklin obeyed : `` Now let 's go out back '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Resignedly , Macklin turned to the back door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was secured by an oversized padlock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Macklin balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They crowded him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once the door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They returned to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its windows glowed with lamplight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He came to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't try it '' , Brannon told him , dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't get yourself killed for something that does n't concern you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He strode past the now frightened man , entered the house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The others followed Brannon inside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly garbed and tough looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horses and cattle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They tracked mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their presence fouled the elegance of that room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But the day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The exception was an Iron Mountain settler named William Lewis .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After walking out to his corral that morning , he 'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A split second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He 'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he 'd estimated the shot had come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had n't even pretended to be farming his spread .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His land had never been plowed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had cursed at them and threatened them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was a man , those neighbors testified later , who did n't have a friend in the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll be ready next time '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">he raged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll be shootin ' right back '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He found nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin ' coward face-to-face '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he exploded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's all I ask '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He never got that chance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A .30-30 bullet smashed directly into the center of William Lewis ' chest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He slumped against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An inquest was held , and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out by then , and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway , the prosecuting attorney , a Colonel Baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It took some time to locate Horn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was finally found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County , two counties away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But that indictment was never made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For Tom Horn , it turned out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The former scout 's alibi could n't be shaken .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The authorities had to release him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He immediately rode on to Cheyenne , threw a ten day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Dead center at three hundred yards , that coroner said '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he 'd grin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Three shots in that fella ' fore he hit the ground !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You reckon there 's two men in this state can shoot like that '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Publicly , he denied everything .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Privately , he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For a blood chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he 'd promised to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tom Horn was soon back at work , giving his secret employers their money 's worth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A good many beef hungry settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The company herds were being raided less often , and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbors .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The rustling problem was by no means solved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on - a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred Powell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle '' his own hired man , Andy Ross , mentioned later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Everyone knew it , but he sort of acted like he did n't care who knew it - even after them notes came , even after he 'd heard about Lewis , even after he 'd been shot at a couple o ' times hisself '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On the morning of September 10 , 1895 , Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day 's work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Haying time was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Harnessing a team to a buckboard , they drove out to a willow lined creek about a half-mile off , then climbed down and began chopping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Andy Ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He looked around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The hired man ran over to help his boss .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` My God , I 'm shot '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Powell gasped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he collapsed and died instantly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman 's hiding place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not even an empty cartridge case could be found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once again , Tom Horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought in for questioning immediately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Later , riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne , he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Exterminatin ' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he 'd blandly announce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` And I sort o ' got a corner on the market '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Tom '' , a friend asked him once , `` how come you bushwhacked them rustlers ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They would n't o ' stood no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had lots of friends , then as always .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No man 's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well '' , he explained , `` s'posin you was a nester swingin ' the long rope ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Which would you be most scairt of - a dry-gulchin ' or a shoot-down '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah , I can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` But , well , it just do n't seem sportin ' somehow '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Sportin '' ' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The tall sunburnt rustler hunter stared in amazement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sportin '' ' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he echoed again in soft wonder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I seen a lot o ' things in my time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill , and another time we ran across some teamsters they 'd caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o ' their skulls .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I heard o ' Texas cattlemen wrappin ' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin ' the sun shrink ' em and squeeze him to death .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But there 's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just do n't think there is , and that 's a sportin ' way o ' killin ' a man '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The lesson had been learned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The examples were plain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Fred Powell 's brother-in-law , Charlie Keane , moved into the dead man 's home , the anonymous letter writer took no chances on Charlie taking up where Fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice :
If you do n't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as Powell 's was .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was the message found tacked to the cabin door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Keane left , within three days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All through Albany and Laramie counties , other men were doing the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Houses of settlers who 'd treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who 'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For three straight years , Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $ 600 a man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $ 125 , very good money in an era when top hands worked for $ 30 and found . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim 's head as a sort of trademark .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">( A detailed search of old coroner 's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest . )</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One thing was certain - his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` My reputation 's my stock in trade '' , Tom mentioned more than once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He evidently could n't foresee that it might be his downfall in the end .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the cow camps , Tom Horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The wailing , guitar strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By 1898 , rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When several minutes had passed and Curt had n't emerged from the livery stable , Brenner re-entered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I have a little job for you , Charlie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'm sure you won n't mind doing me a small favor '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brenner 's voice was oily , but Summers was n't fooled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He moistened his lips uneasily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brenner shrugged carelessly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's very simple .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell her to come here to the hotel '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Vastly relieved , Summers nodded and started toward the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` One thing , Summers '' , Brenner said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're not to mention my name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Summers pulled up short , and turned around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I do n't know , Mr. Brenner '' , he said haltingly , beginning to get an inkling of Brenner 's plans .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` It does n't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Could n't I just '' - His voice trailed off into silence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he had n't before noticed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You know , Summers '' , he said thoughtfully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Eagle 's Nest ought to have a fire company .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a haystack '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He started toward the stairway , then turned to add , `` Tell her to come to Adams 's room , that Adams is in trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell her to hurry '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes sir '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His face pale , Summers headed for the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Curt 's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess 's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fact that Jess 's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane 's information had been wrong , but Curt did n't interpret it this way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black 's house without using the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Curt approached the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a light in Black 's front room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Curt circled the house and located a barn out back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He could hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfastened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He opened the door and went in , pulling it shut behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Again he stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He moved ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden partition .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He found a match in his pocket and lit it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch 's buckskin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Curt snuffed out the match .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was Stacey Black .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Curt wanted to get Jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as spineless a person as the store owner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Reaching across the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the rump .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As Curt had hoped , the house door banged open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Curt moved over beside the door and waited .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess 's smothered curses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The door swung open , and Jess said sourly , `` What the hell 's the matter with you ? ''</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The horse continued to snort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner 's voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jess cursed again , and entered the barn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A match flared , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As he crossed to the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Before you try anything '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Remember what happened to Gruller '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jess caught his breath in surprise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He started to reach for his gun , but apparently hammer it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's the stuff '' , Curt said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Just hold it that way '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You and I have a little talking to do , Jess .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You won n't be needing this '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He moved up and lifted Jess 's pistol out of its holster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">`` Damn you , Adams '' - Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We ai n't got nothing to talk about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If I do n't come back in the house , Breed 's going to '' -
`` Your trigger-happy brother is n't in the house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">About now he 's probably having supper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That long ride the four of you took must 've given him a good appetite .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now turn around so I can see your face '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jess turned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You 're about as dumb as they come , Adams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I do n't know what you 're up to , but when Brenner '' -
`` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's Ben Arbuckle we 're going to talk about '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Arbuckle '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jess stiffened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know nothin ' about him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I suppose you do n't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; one with blood all over it , Arbuckle 's blood '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Curt 's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` So help me , Crouch , I 'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before I do , I 'm going to hear you admit killing him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now start talking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who told you to do it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Was it Dutch Brenner '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Curt was holding Jess 's gun in his left hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess 's face , but did n't finish the motion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pistol whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess , but Curt could n't bring himself to do it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Having all the guns makes you a big man , do n't it , Adams ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If we was both armed , you would n't talk so tough '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Curt reached out and dropped Jess 's pistol back into the holster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He retreated a step and holstered his own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` All right , Crouch ; we 're on even terms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now draw '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sweat bubbled out on Jess 's swarthy face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw , but he did n't reach for the gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Curt , angry enough to be a little reckless , raised his hands shoulder high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Does this make it any easier , coward '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I ai n't drawin ' against you '' , Jess said thickly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I heard how you outdrew Chico .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I ai n't a gunslinger '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I just wanted to hear you say so '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He had found Curt 's weakness , or what to Jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take advantage of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Somewhere in the distance , a woman screamed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had to make Jess talk , and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once more he lifted Jess 's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He dropped his own beside it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 'll do it another way , then '' , he said harshly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jess 's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt 's fist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Curt managed to duck beneath the man 's flailing fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess 's mid section .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was like hitting a sack of salt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Pain shout up Curt 's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He slammed into the wall , bounced back , and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An inch lower and it would have knocked him out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As it was , his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When his eyes began to focus , he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Curt twisted to one side , and the tines of the fork bit into the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The tines broke off under Jess 's twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt 's brains out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His aim was hurried ; so the pitchfork whistled over Curt 's head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By now Curt was seeing clearly again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stepped inside Jess 's guard and landed two blows to the big man 's belly , putting everything he had behind them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They made Jess double over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When his head came down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The building shook , setting the lantern to swaying , and the buckskin to pitching again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Even Black 's old crowbait began to snort , and from the house Black yelled , `` Jess !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What 's going on out there '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jess did n't seem too sure himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He lurched drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jess had had enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Blood gushed from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt 's fists .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Curt was in almost as bad shape , but he would n't quit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He backed Jess into a corner , grabbed a handful of the man 's shirtfront , and drew back his right fist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tell me about Arbuckle !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You killed him , did n't you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It was Brenner 's idea '' , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` He found out about you and Arbuckle talking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You mean anyone who stood up for his rights '' , Curt said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He let go of the shirt , and Jess slumped to the floor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Turning his back , Curt crossed to the stall , reached over to untie the buckskin 's halter rope , and waved his hand in the animal 's face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The buckskin bolted out of the stall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Curt moved in and picked up his gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leaving Jess 's where it lay , he left the stall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Get up , Crouch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We 're going someplace '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Who 's in there '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Black called fearfully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Curt opened the door , grabbed Black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're staying right here for a while .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I 'm going to let him tell it to somebody else '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He shoved Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Get out of here .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 're coming along peacefully , or I 'll put a bullet in your leg '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jess stumbled through the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Curt followed , reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Black would have little trouble getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Where 're you takin ' me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jess asked worriedly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 're going to Marshal Woods 's house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe if the marshal hears this himself , it 'll make a difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Somebody in this town must still have some backbone '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While no larger than Dutch Springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch , this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Gyp 'll be holdin ' forth in some bar if he 's here at all '' , Cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were no less than six or seven saloons in Ganado , not counting the lower class dives , all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pat only nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Take one side of the street , and I 'll take the other '' , he proposed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cobb 's assent was tight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You do the same .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's all I ask , Stevens '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Separating , they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually , even were he to prove the thief .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He tramped out of the Miners Rest with his hopes plummeting , and headed doggedly for the Palace Saloon , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Palace was an elaborate establishment , built practically on stilts in front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird 's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The front windows of the place were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Heading for the batwings , Cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window , and suddenly dodged aside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nerves tight as a bowstring , he paused to gather his wits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Against all expectation , Carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fierce anger surged through Russ .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he feverishly scanned the busy street below .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stevens was nowhere in sight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Muffling an exclamation , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What luck , Cobb '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he said swiftly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Russ pointed upward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 's there '' , he got out tersely , curbing his rising excitement .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hitching his cartridge belt around , Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb at his side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Climbing the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pat pushed through first .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Forced behind him momentarily , Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His eyes widened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry , with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track , and another dozed at one of the card tables .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the sleek headed bartender absently polished a glass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Looking the setup over , Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where yuh goin '' ' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was the barkeep .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Halting , Pat turned to survey him deliberately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not reply , going on toward the back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Less assured than the tall , wide shouldered man in the lead , Cobb followed alertly , a hand on his gun butt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He said no more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A hall opened in back of the bar , running toward an ell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pat moved into it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Small rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All the doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The door was locked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A single kick made it spring open , shuddering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pat saw Gyp Carmer staggering forward , a half filled bottle upraised as if to strike .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With a bellow Carmer lunged at him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But he was more than half drunk , and his faculties were dulled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He started to struggle up , heaving desperately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kneeling , Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Okay , Stevens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 've drawn his fangs '' , he snapped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Go through his pockets , will you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If we have to we 'll take him apart and see what he 's made of '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Complying methodically , Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope waning by the moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer 's hat , which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cobb got it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Straightening up , his eyes ablaze , he held out the battered Stetson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Look at this '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Inside the crown , stuffed behind the stained sweatband , could be seen thin , crumpled wads of currency .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Carmer 's ingenious cache for his loot had been found .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` By golly , Stevens !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You were right '' , Russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of Carmer 's hat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That is , if we can be sure this is Colcord 's money '' -
Pat grunted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Where else would he get it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Count what you 've got there , Cobb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We can soon tell '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pat nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's within a hundred of what Crip had '' , he declared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We know Penny spent some - and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Handing the money over , Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Shall we get out of here '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leaving the card room , they moved back through the Palace the way they had come .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Glowering looks met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to halt them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him , Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He and Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Neither spoke till they reached their horses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pat paused there , looking across at the young fellow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It 'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord and tell him about it , Russ `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He started to return it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not me '' , he ruled decidedly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 've had enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was you that tracked it down anyway , Stevens `` , he pursued strictly .
''</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll shove along home `` .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Whatever you say '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Old Crip was n't '' , retorted Cobb tartly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He 'll know when you tell him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I want this to sink in awhile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then maybe next time he won n't be so quick on the trigger '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs .
''</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You 're the doctor `` , he returned with a smile .
''</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I still think Penny 's an awful nice girl , Russ `` -
`` You do n't have to tell me '' , flashed Cobb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Giving the other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pat let him go , following more leisurely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for Antler .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The truth was , the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Penny 's always glad to see me over there '' , he mused bleakly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet had he not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober 's part in recent events .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Gyp Carmer could n't have known about Colcord 's money unless he was told - and who else would have told him '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">he asked himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's the second time War Ax hands made a play for that money .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How much of an accident could that be `` ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; but on the range gunfire had a meaning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hauling up , Russ listened carefully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two minutes later it came again - a double explosion , followed by a third , sounding more distant .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He tightened up in a twinkling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So far as he knew , only his father could be there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What did it mean ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Still a quarter-mile away , the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Setting a course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">When it was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He knew now what he was up against .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested , he had his answer a moment later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Over this way !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He ai n't gone far '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">a harsh cry floated to him across the brush .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A carbine cracked more loudly , and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dismounting , Russ looked about hastily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Toward the west this depression led toward a draw .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Leading his pony , he hurried that way , not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Swinging up then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the meandering draw .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A slug had torn half of his stirrup guard away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A second twitched his shirtsleeve , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Another snarled close overhead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Jumping Jerusalem !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let 's get out of here '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sweeping a look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He heard cries from behind him , but he could make out no words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunged forward with undiminished speed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gradually the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet he must chance it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He clambered out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And Sweeney Squadron put its first marks on the combat record .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Every plane that could fly was sent into the air .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A weapons carrier took Greg , Todman , Belton , Banjo Ferguson , and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No one had much to say .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The sky glowered down at them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Donovan snatched Greg 's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've got her as neat as I can '' , Donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg 's shoulders .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But this goddamn climate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's for carabao not airplanes '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 'll make out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Do n't you worry , chief '' , Greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">See you '' , Donovan said as he jumped off the wing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The expression was his trade-mark , his open sesame to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the prearranged time , Greg started the engine and taxied out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yet long before the scheduled time for return , Donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The pilots ' heads looked ridiculously small .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Greg 's mission was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To the west , the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He possessed the fighter pilot 's horror of bad weather and instrument flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He shivered in the warm cockpit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The overcast was solid above him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it did n't close in before they returned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Todman , let 's try to go under this stuff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stay in close and we 'll go up the valley '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Roger , Sweeney '' , Todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg took the formation wide around three A-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty degree turn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was only a fifteen minute flight , but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The formation remained perfect .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Somebody beat us to it '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Visibility continued to be limited , and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was frustrating .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Greg 's area remained as placid as a Florida dawn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally , as time began to run out , he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The low clouds made bombing difficult .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The accuracy was deplorable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of Greg 's bombs hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mercifully , it was still open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was about to make a gas check on his flight when Todman 's voice broke in : `` Sweeneys !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three bogies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Twelve o'clock level '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg 's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw them , specks against the gray , but closing fast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were headed straight for each other on a collision course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Friend or enemy ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The same old question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And only a few seconds to answer it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Zeros '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Todman said excitedly , and hopefully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And then he thought Todman might be right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He narrowed the shape down to two : either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If it were the enemy , tactically his position was correct .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he had n't been spotted already .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In seconds , Greg made his decision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He pushed the radio button .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sweeney Blue , hit the deck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lots of throttle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Todman , you take the one on the left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll take the middle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Belton , the one on the right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If & & & if they 're Japs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let 's make sure first '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` Rogers '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg 's airspeed indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The opposing aircraft continued to come on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They appeared to be the enemy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was , of course , no way for the other planes to get by them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was a box .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But they could turn and escape to the east .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg pushed the radio button again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Todman , drop your second element back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now let 's make sure they 're Japs '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Even as he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His hands shook .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Arm your guns , Sweeneys '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They 're Japs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They 're Japs '' , came a high-pitched voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Greg to Sweeney Blue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One pass only .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No turns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 'll bust your ass in this canyon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's an order '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He moved the flights over against one wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight turn recovery .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the RPM , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They have n't seen us '' , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They have n't seen us '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hit the radio button .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now , Sweeneys , now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let 's take ' em home '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Out of the corner of his eye , he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perfect , he thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He tightened his turn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His nose up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was going to be dangerous .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eight aircraft in this small box .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Please , dear God , make my pilots good , he prayed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The enemy did not veer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It did not seem possible that they had n't been spotted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Blind fools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg 's fingers closed on the stick trigger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The plane rumbled and slowed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Luck was with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Jap 's propeller flew off in pieces .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A large piece of engine cowling vanished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was all Greg had time to see .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost inverted and heading up into the clouds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His speed was dropping rapidly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wingman , stay clear , he prayed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He fought the panic of vertigo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had no idea which was up and which was down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He held the controls where they had been .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Over the rattling of fenders , humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cool air moving slowly through the open or smashed out side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation , and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Moriarty '' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone I once more repeated the absurdity , mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We were coming to an intersection , turning right , chuffing to a stop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican : Moriarty , New Mexico .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Gracias .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Adios '' , I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely tapped store of smiles with my host 's daughters .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then I saw the father 's head slightly turn ; gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Autos whizzed past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">White shirted and conservatively cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumbing hopefully , I saw emergent in windshield flash : red lips , streaming silk of blonde hair and - ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair - the leering face of old Herry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Mor-ee-air-teeeee '' , he shrieked , his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Over the rapidly diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage Herry 's black brushcut was just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot where - hidden - more delicately textured , most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Damn his luck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and - Well , at least I would n't have shouted back a taunt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was stopping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag , I heard : `` Sahjunt Yoorick , meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The voice was that of Johnson , tail gunner off another crew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Squeezing a look between Johnson 's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired `` Y ' all drahve '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Onleh one thiihng '' , Mrs. Roebuck continued .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ahm goin nawth t ' jawn mah husbun in Sante Fe , an y ' all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Corporal Johnson has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t ' hi-im '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I said that it did n't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How far I knew will shortly become apparent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck `` wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit '' ( 35 m. p. h . )</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` is still in ee-faket '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I let up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 m. p. h. which would , I hoped , overhaul Herry and the blonde , and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I , Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When Johnson ejaculated `` Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Co-cola , Ma ' am '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mrs. Roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son , who was `` onleh a little younguh than you bawhs '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Roebuck thought Johnson was a `` sweet bawh t ' lah lahk thet '' , but her Herman was getting to be a man , there was no getting around it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Just befoh he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh , Major Roebuck an Ah , an Huhmun says ' May Ah hev one too ' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">just as p ' lite an - an cohnfidunt , an Ah says ' Uh coahse you cai n't ' , but he says ' Whah nawt , you ah hevin one ' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">an Ah coudn ansuh him an so Ah said ' Aw right , Ah gay-ess , an his fathuh did n uttuh one wohd an aftuh Huhmun was gone , the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t ' gethuh f ' ovuh a yeah , onleh an occasional one , but just the same it was behahn mah back , an Ah doa n think thet 's nahce at all , d ' you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` No , I do n't '' , Johnson said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm a good Baptist , and drinking & & & '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mrs. Roebuck very kindly let me drive through Sante Fe to a road which would , she said , lead us to Taos and then Raton and `` eventshahleh '' out of New Mexico .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How lightly her `` eventshah-leh '' passed into the crannies where I was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus , and how the word would echo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And re-echo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hardly had Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck , father or grandfather of Senor `` Moriarty 's '' Ford sedan , came screeching to a dust swirling stop , and a brown face appeared , its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Get in , buddies .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Get in '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The straight , black hair flopped in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Johnson unwired the right hand door , whose window was , like the left one , merely loosely taped fragments of glass , and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` In back , buddy '' , the driver said to me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side rack , I stepped on the running board ; it flopped down , sprang back up and gouged my shin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The truck was hurtling forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I seized the rack and made a western style flying mount just in time , one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag - and merely wrecking my camera , I was to discover later - my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and - but this is no medical report .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck 's similarity to Senor X 's Ford turtle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whatever satisfaction that might offer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Something pulled my leg .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I drew back , drawing back my foot for a kick .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing , which half covered the truck cab 's glassless rear window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I though he was only having a little joke , but , no , he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Wanna beer '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hell , yes '' , I roared back between dusty lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did I want a beer ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did an anteater want ants ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Bueno , amigo .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Gracias '' , I hollered , my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my Spanish vocabulary .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At once my ears were drowned by a flow of what I took to be Spanish , but - the driver 's white teeth flashing at me , the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair , beyond his gesticulating bottle - it could have been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing ; I would n't have known the difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Johnson was trying to grab the wheel , though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">White teeth suddenly vanishing , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson 's ear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We were off the road , gleaming barbed wire pulling taut .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We were in a field , in a tight , screeching turn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Prairie dogs were popping up and popping down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I fell on my back , I saw a vulture hovering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Just as I got to my knees , there was again the sound of the fence stretching , and I had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This time no wire came whipping into the truck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We were back on the road .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I regained my squatting position behind the truck cab 's rear window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Johnson 's left hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tee-wah '' , the driver cackled , his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That was Tee-wah I was talking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You thought I was a Mexican , did n't you , buddy '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hell , that 's all right , buddy '' , the Indian ( I now guessed ) said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Drink your beer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Miraculously , the bottle was still in my hand , foam still geysering over my ( luckily ) waterproof watch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No sooner had I started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The beer foamed furiously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I drank furiously .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A long time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Emptied the bottle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Teeth again flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which `` amigo '' appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I bobbed my head each time it appeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son of a bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into Johnson 's quivering ribs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The car was just about to us , its driver 's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in Sante Fe - on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I tossed the bottle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">High , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car 's steel roof .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Too high .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Aye-yah-ah-ah '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Indian was again raising his bottle , but to my astonished relief - probably only a fraction of Johnson 's - the bottle this time went to the Indian 's lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod - anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We were slowing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the ditch sand was white and soft looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But Johnson could n't quickly unwire the truck door , and if I escaped , he might suffer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The car was approaching fast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">On the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery ; with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin -
Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was no time to pick out a penny ; I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger , leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash ; the car 's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I heard the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Looking back I saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` S-s-sahjunt '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Johnson 's fat hand , another bottle were protruding from the truck cab , and that self proclaimed Baptist teetotaler , had a bottle at his own lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two cars came over a crest , their chrome and glass flashing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Indian 's arm whipped sidewise - there was a flash of amber and froth , the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Brakes shrieked behind us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I saw Johnson 's bottle snatched from his hand , saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car 's rear window .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Drink , you son of a bitch '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I quickly turned around and began to drink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the Indian was jabbing another bottle toward Johnson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I guided her to the divan , turned off the TV , faced her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She sat quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And what eyes they were .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Big and dark , a melting , golden brown .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Eyes like hot honey , eyes that sizzled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Plus flawless skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a disturbingly familiar face , too , but I could n't remember where we had met .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I said , `` Do we know each other , Miss '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` No , I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think of was - '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This time she stopped the rush of words herself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm sorry .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Shall I go on '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She smiled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was her first smile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But worth waiting for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sure '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` But one word at a time , O. K . '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She was still hugging the stained coat around her , so I said , `` Relax , let me take your things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would you like a drink , or coffee '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , thanks '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She stood up , pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off , then let out a high-pitched scream and I let out a low-pitched , wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was wearing nothing beneath the coat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out , and now I was certain I 'd seen her somewhere before .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I forgot '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she yelped .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , do forgive me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I 'm sorry '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I forgive - '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's what started all the trouble in the first place .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oh , dear , I 'm all unstrung '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You and me both , dear .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Have n't we & & & have n't I seen you & & & .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I mean , surely we 've - '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You may have seen me on TV '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've done several filmed commercials for - '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then it hit me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` ZING '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I cried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why , yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And you recognized me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , indeed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact , I was watching you on that little seventeen inch screen when you rang my bell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Man , you rang - it was in color , too , Miss , and & & & Miss ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What 's your name , anyway ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ah , you were splendid '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I sat by her on the divan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Splendid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a waterfall and all that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's the last one we did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was a fun one '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll bet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was fun for me , all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I do n't mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I mean : Is advertising honest ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It depends on who does it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I never wear anything at all .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would n't - would n't seem fair , somehow '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I could n't agree with you more '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I really do have something important to tell you , Mr. Scott .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">About the murder '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Murder ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oh , yeah '' , I said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Tell me about the murder '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She told me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">ZING was the creation of two men , Louis Thor and Bill Blake , partners in ZING !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">, Inc. .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They 'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when - with the addition of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign - sales had soared practically into orbit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their product had been endorsed by Good Housekeeping , the A. M. A. , and the Veterinary Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you did n't bathe .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">My lovely caller - Joyce Holland was her name - had previously done three filmed commercials for ZING , and this evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis Thor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The water in Thor 's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds - fashioned , of course , from ZING - Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The finished - and drastically cut - product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool 's surface clad in layers of lavender lather , and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap ; even to clean men and boys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Joyce went on , `` When we 'd finished , Lou - Mr. Thor - asked me to stay a little longer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He wanted a few stills for magazine ads , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Everybody left and I stayed in the pool , then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he did n't have any clothes on '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` He did n't '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , he did n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did , I mean '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She paused .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Did leap into the pool , and did n't have anything on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anyway , it was evident what he had in mind '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You got away , did n't you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He caught up with me once and grabbed me , but I was all covered with ZING - it 's very slippery , you know '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I did n't know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I would n't have the stuff in the house .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I 'm pleased to hear - '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` So I just scooted out of his clutches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I swam like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my robe , and ran to the car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The keys were still in it , and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I 'd changed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She 'd driven around for a while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time , she 'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive , parked in front , and walked toward the pool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While several yards from it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she 'd seen two men on her left at the pool 's edge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She went on :
`` A man was holding onto Lou , holding him up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe Lou was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The man shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There 's a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I was so scared , well , I just ran to my car and came here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You know who the other man was '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` No , I never did see his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I did n't get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and I was so scared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was just somebody in a man 's suit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I 'm sure the other one was Lou '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor 's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes - and handbag containing her identification .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She realized I 'd have to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her impact in the ZING commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater Western Eye , a documentary type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor 's wife , Mrs. Oatnut Grits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Or at least not to Joyce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` And I so want the part '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` The commercials have just been for money , there has n't been any real incentive for me to do them , but in Underwater Western Eye I 'd have a chance to act .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I could show what I can do '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As far as I was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those worth waiting for smiles , and I smiled all the way into the bedroom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Joyce squirmed a little on the divan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm starting to itch '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Itch '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , I 'm still all covered with that soap .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was loaded with suds when I ran away , and I have n't had a chance to wash it off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mmmm , it sure itches '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You might as well wait here while I 'm gone , so you can use my shower if you 'd like '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Oh , I 'd love to '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really do n't mind , I think I 'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That always relaxes me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Does n't it you '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Only when I do it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I shook my head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Soak as long as you want , Joyce .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So you 'll have everything all to yourself , doggone '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I looked at my watch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ten after nine .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Time to go , I supposed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , goodbye '' , I said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Goodbye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 'd better hurry '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , you can count on that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She smiled slightly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Softly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Warmly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't hurry too much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'll be soaking for at least half an hour '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was all she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But suddenly those hot honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">However , when there 's a job to be done , I 'm a monstrosity of grim determination , I like to think .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hot water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She would n't be taking a cold shower .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hell , she could n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan , and it took me less than five minutes to get there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I 'd expected .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I followed a shrubbery lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two uniformed officers , a couple of plain-clothesmen I knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the pool 's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water 's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp looking lather .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A few yards beyond the group of men , a man 's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lieutenant Rawlins , one of the plain-clothesmen , spotted me and said , `` Hi , Shell '' , and walked toward me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How 'd you hear about this one '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I grinned , but ignored the question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did n't push it ; Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we 'd been friends for years .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He filled me in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine p. m. , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that - 10 minutes ago now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Present at the scene - in addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis Thor - had been Thor 's partner Bill Blake , and Antony Rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the ZING account .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the filming session earlier .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What were they doing here '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I asked Rawlins .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` They were supposed to meet Thor at nine p. m. for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yeah , I 've heard more about SX-21 than space exploration lately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is the gunk '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` How would I know ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's a secret .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was the new advertising angle - something about a Lloyd's of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Actually , only two men know what the formula is , Blake and '' - He stopped and looked at Thor 's body .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I said , `` O. K. , so now only Blake knows .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How 's it strike you , foul or fair '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Ca n't say yet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on ' em .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The PM might show he drowned instead , but that 's what the once-over-lightly gives us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Accident , murder , suicide - take your pick '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll pick murder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anything else '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool equipment locker and started hauling him out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were west of the Sabine , but only God knew where .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For three days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson ; suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Hoa-whup '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">he commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He spat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The dust thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing , grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The burning air dried his sweat soaked clothes in salt edged patches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He cleared his throat and wet his lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As cheerfully as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it was water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Thank the Lord , they still had water !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He took a long but carefully controlled draught .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What happens when there 's no more water '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she asked smolderingly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was like charcoal , he thought - dark , opaque , explosive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And all the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not visibly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There must be some water under there '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And add fever to our troubles '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">she scoffed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever , too '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We can boil it '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her chin sharpened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` We 're lost and burning up already '' , she bit out tensely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The tires are rattling on the wheels now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They 'll roll off in another day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no valley like this on your map .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You do n't even know where we 're headed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we 're still headed west .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Somewhere , we 'll hit a trail '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Somewhere ! ''</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she repeated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His wide mouth compressed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a way , he could n't blame her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had picked out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was n't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She had hated the whole idea before they started .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It had been five days too late before he learned that she 'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He had left her inviolate , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stared at the dipper , turning it over and over in his wide , calloused hands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Do n't try to be noble '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her laugh was hard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` They would n't have sold me in the first place if there 'd been food enough to go around '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He winced .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hettie , they did n't sell you '' , he said miserably .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer back in Carolina , but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what 's inside of them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Without money or property , what would you have had at Baton Rouge '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I might have starved , but at least I would n't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He darkened under his heavy burn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them - heavy , ominous , leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hollered hoarsely , `` Hang on '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">and goaded the oxen as he yelled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He swung up over the wheel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You had better get inside '' , he warned her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But she sat on in stubborn silence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The six ton Conestoga began to whip and shake .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their world turned black .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And then came the water - not rain , but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Through the splash of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , gnashing big chunks out of the banks .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The jetting , frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept on rising .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cloudburst cut off abruptly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The water level was higher than their hubs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now and then , the glistening side of a half swamped object showed as it swept past .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Out of compulsion to say something cheery , Ben Prime blurted , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At least , the wheels dug in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His wife did n't give a sign she 'd heard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Somebody was riding the tree .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting astride an upright branch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She did not call out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up jutting branch turned slowly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pale blob of the woman disappeared .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` There 's the one who 's lucky '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">the girl murmured harshly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ben 's eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts , needing their comfort more than they needed his .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , half swimming his way , for he was not a tall man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were already swollen to bursting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of all their worldly belongings , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most treasured .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was spoiled now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The oxen might as well enjoy it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; there was not a match width of damp mark to show they were receding .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A terrible , numbing sense of futility swept over him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hope surged within him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Still , he felt better .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A tight wagon meant so much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvaging the chunky , watery messes for biscuits of a sort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their jams and jellies had not suffered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He looked thoughtfully at his wife 's trunk , holding her meager treasures .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said hesitantly , `` Hettie , I do n't figure your things got wet too much .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's a good trunk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you want to get them aired '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in atop the dust , there is n't a thing that won n't be streaked '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Spencer said nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Spencer shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alexander said , `` Answer me properly , Spencer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Spencer was quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` There is nothing I want to say , Captain '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Very well '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alexander walked away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Philip Spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During the morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the Somers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Those named in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so as to be near Spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hostile glances were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The two met in the Captain 's cabin .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What is the next step , Captain '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` More arrests , I fear '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In your opinion , who is this E. Andrews on the ' certain ' list `` ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Cromwell , of course .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He saw the dangers , not the glories of being identified as a mutineer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Somehow he talked Spencer into letting him use another name '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There was a tap at the door and Oliver entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Have him come in '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">McKinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer 's possession and that '' -
`` Where did you gather all this information , Heiser ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who '' -
He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The aimless milling about of what had been a well trained , well organized crew struck Alexander with horror .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Adrien Deslonde hastened to Alexander 's side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Small violently jerked the weather royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I saw him myself and it was done after consultation with Cromwell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I swear it , sir '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And it was clear that Adrien was not mistaken , for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till Philip Spencer had given the signal to obey .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip Spencer 's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Spencer 's potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after Midshipman Tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by Seaman Wilson .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tillotson had reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , brandishing the weapon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wilson , shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , McKee and McKinley .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not a man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three days had passed since Spencer 's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Gansevoort said , `` It requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To have the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From actions aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer 's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Well '' , Heiser ventured , `` why do n't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' -
`` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the United States , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Heiser , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wales said , `` Of course they would .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are about to do so at any moment as it is .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going to be rushed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We are going to be rushed and murdered '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That is extravagant language , Mr. Wales .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We are not going to be rushed and murdered '' , Alexander said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We are going to bring the Somers into New York harbor safe and sound '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Of course , I agree with the Captain '' , Gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The instinct of discipline has been lost .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` We ourselves must stand sentinel '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alexander said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Under arms day and night , watch and watch about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those of us present , the Perry brothers , Deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the Somers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A great deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And when he was alone again in the cabin , Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With all his heart he had loved the Navy and now he must act in accordance with the Navy 's implacable laws .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And when he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated his soul .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where had he failed ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How had he failed ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He who had tried so hard , who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It came to him as he wept there aboard the Somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was given or it was not given .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One did one 's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One did one 's best and if fortune frowned , an eighteen year old boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one 's ship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And Alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">God knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an egotist 's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was for love that he had served the Navy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To have someday that love returned was what he had lived for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now the hope was gone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yes , he would bring the Somers safely into New York harbor but at a price .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dear God , at what a price .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And after a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Stern faced , he inspected the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Only Cromwell , the giant boatswain , was mild-mannered and respectful .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He said , `` Captain , may I speak , please ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Captain , I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Are you , Cromwell '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , sir .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before God I swear I am innocent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I know nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You are the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He leaned closer to Alexander , squinting up at him from the deck .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Surely , Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , Cromwell , I did not find your name .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You were careful about that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now Spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He said , `` Cromwell is telling you the truth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is innocent '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And in a sudden wave of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a kinship with Spencer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There was good fortune and there was bad and Philip Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The red haired captain , towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This tragic lad had forged his own shackles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red haired captain , they would be each other 's undoing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was your constant companion '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The hazel eyes met Alexander 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I tell you he is innocent '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's true '' , Spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His eyes went back to contemplation of the sea .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I am innocent , Captain '' , Cromwell said again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Before God , Captain , I am innocent '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The boatswain was as guilty as any .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in Cromwell 's hands while Spencer whispered explanations .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I thought '' , Midshipman Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer 's followers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And I 'll take you with me '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The two of them against the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That had been how she imagined it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For when he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But now the dream was over .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The big waking up had happened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What did I imagine '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Did I see him about to swing low in a chariot ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or maybe poling up the south fork of the Forked Deer River braving the wastes dumped in it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe I saw him on a barge with a gang of Ethiopians poling it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I 'll take you with me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had taken her all right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wednesday nights after youth fellowship .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when Gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And Gratt Shafer would be in Memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Like Mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Or you could hope the parachute would n't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to Starkey Poe in his suit of red underwear , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid - a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I 'm pregnant '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You could wish that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Or you could wish your daddy would really do it - kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won n't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He can even be a mild voiced little town guy with big town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even Houdini could n't figure out , how it is unlocked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he can be on the way to Memphis , your Gratt Shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him - really want him - dead .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Because if you can n't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For you do n't share him , not even with God .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If it is love , you do n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And I 'll take you with me .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Even if that 's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even when he is on the way to Memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You feel him every mile further away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she did n't particularly give a damn whether she got him or did n't .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you did n't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he could n't afford and the too shiny shoes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You think : `` Did he feel that way about me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you could n't have Gratt Shafer ; that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because Gratt Shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt Shafer 's substitute , that other guy .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You wonder about the Christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you could n't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted - to give them you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Damn the world '' , she thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She looked out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence bordering the grounds .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The mayor envisioned factories there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The bands were impatient , but they were the only ones .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The others , the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York City .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While he talked you would n't trade being a West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it had n't , in six weeks , rained enough to wet a rat 's ass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She glanced at the man nodding beside her , a man with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks , with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts he had seen , reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in August - yes , with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only June , only festival time again and thoughts of Gratt Shafer would not leave her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I should have stayed at the store '' , she thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Back at the Factory-to-You with the other old maids , back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions , like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no lock because Herman did n't allow a lock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The toilet had n't had a sincere scrubbing in years and there were things written on the walls of the little boxed in place because you could n't keep the public out - entirely .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She could not count the times Herman had rapped on the door , just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break away the pipe connections from the wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on Saturdays and during sales , and there were no chairs and you could n't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Among us , we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Each of us had his own specialty besides .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">George did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a medieval miniature : hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight by ten sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's glass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He also drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic journals , The New Yorker , for instance , or Esquire .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints : naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The book could be The Brothers Karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie Press ; the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the fifteenth century armor , furnishings , clothes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made - linden wood covered with leather - so I 'd get the light reflections accurate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">McKenzie , the art editor , took one look at my finished sketch and said , `` Nothing doing , Rufus .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the first place , it 's static ; in the second place , it does n't look authentic ; and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place - you 've got six colors there including gold '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I said , `` Mr. McKenzie , it is as authentic as careful research can make it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He said , `` That may be , but it is n't authentic the way readers think .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like Little Lord Fauntleroy , and only the villains had beards .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And girls could n't have dressed like that - it is n't transparent enough '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the end , I did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a sword instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">McKenzie was as happy as a clam .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's authenticity '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As for Donald , he actually sold paintings .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We all painted in our spare time , and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not much ; he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce Monmouth or her friends .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had style , a real inner vision of his very own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was strange stuff - it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it did n't prevent the paintings from being exciting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He also had , at times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For Christ's sake , Donald , you 've got Prussian blue all over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Monmouth thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was all gravy , and Donald did n't need much to live on ; none of us did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Attending the life class was my idea - or rather , Askington 's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two would n't have gone if I had n't talked them into it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I wanted to paint again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I had n't done a serious picture in almost a year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was n't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I kept saying , `` If I could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an illustrator - like Peter Askington , for instance - then I could take some time off and paint '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; I had admired him long before I talked to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The night we first met , at one of Mrs. Monmouth 's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off 's rent for a year .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was fifteen years older than I - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He did n't look like what I thought of as an old man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Life had included him in its `` Modern American Artists '' series and had photographed him at his studio in the East Sixties ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I had a long talk with him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We went into Mrs. Monmouth 's library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a Modigliani portrait , a Jackson Pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background , that looked like an inscription from a Martian tomb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The fireplace had tiles made for Mrs. Monmouth by Picasso himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the course of our talk , Askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` By yourself '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I do n't think I 've reached the point , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Besides , it 's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters , as Durer went to Italy to meet Bellini and Mantegna '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He made a circle with his thumb and fingers .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Painting is n't this big , you know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It does n't embrace only the artist , alone before his easel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He threw his arms wide , his face shining .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` The artist is like a fragment of a mosaic - no , he is more than that , a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One of these days , I 'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that 's being painted these days , from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism , and then you 'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The eye is all , inward or outward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ah , what a title for the exhibition : The Eye is All '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What do you study '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was fascinated ; just listening to him made me feel intelligent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Maybe you know him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He teaches at the Manhattan School of Art '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I had studied with Burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me , along with the five-hundred dollar prize for my paintings of bums on Hudson Street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Burns and I had not loved each other .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm also studying enameling with Hajime Iijima '' , he went on , `` and twice a week I go to a life class taught by Pendleton '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Osric Pendleton '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` My God , is he still alive ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He must be a million years old .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I went to a retrospective of his work when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne 's '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Not quite '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Askington laughed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` He 's about sixty , now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Still painting , still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He even makes the city look like one of Thoreau 's hangouts .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I 've always admired him , and when I heard he was taking a few pupils , I went to him and joined his class '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Yes , it sounds great '' , I said , `` but suppose you do n't think of yourself as an impressionist painter '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're missing the point '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` He has the magical eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And he is a great man .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Contact with him is stimulating .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And that 's the trouble with so many artists today .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They lack stimulation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They sit alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That 's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the Middle Ages , in the Renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was an artisan , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He filled a real need , showing society what it looked like , turning it inside out , portraying its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was a propagandist - they were n't afraid of the word , then - satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But look at us today !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels , and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A bunch of amateur dervishes !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What we need is to get back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He could certainly talk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio - or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself - and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading `` out to work '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a way , Askington was right .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Stimulating '' was the word for it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do n't know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it to be .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Partly , it was because Pendleton himself was n't what I anticipated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No , that is n't quite fair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Actually , there was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I had a rather small place of my own .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A nice bachelor apartment in a place called the Lancaster Arms '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Uhhu '' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And then I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Uhhu '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'm not a man who has many close intimate friends , Carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , I 'd drink with newspaper people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think I was what you might call a convivial man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really felt alive .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , what about you , Carla '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Me '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she asked , turning slowly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What about me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Did you make friends easily '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Umm , uhhu '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Somehow I imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How about it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I guess so '' , she said taking a Kleenex from her purse .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When she had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth , she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Are your people still alive '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">he asked , trying to touch a part of her life Alberto had n't discussed ; so he could have something of her for himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You talk so well , Carla '' , he went on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` You seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he added , trying to flatter her vanity .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You must have been good at history at school .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where did you go to school '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What is this '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she asked , turning suddenly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't you know all about me by this time ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My name 's Carla Caneli .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is my town .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I sleep with you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You know something more about me every day , do n't you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would you be happier if I made up some stories about my life , told you some lies ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why are you trying to worry me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm not trying to worry you '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Well , all right then '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">he wondered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her stockings , make the bed while she lay around ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He straightened up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` What 's the matter '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she asked suddenly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Nothing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nothing at all '' , he said quietly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Let 's go out '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Are those the only shoes you have , Sam '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What 's the matter with them '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The heavy thick soles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Look at them '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` They 're an expensive English shoe for walking around a lot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I like them '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sam , no one around here wears such heavy soles .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ca n't you get another pair '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` Maybe I could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I 'll get an elegant pair of thin soled Italian shoes tomorrow , Carla '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` And I do n't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What 's the matter with it '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had put on the gray jacket and the dark gray slacks and the fawn colored shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had encountered her on the street .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , Sam .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You look like a tweedy Englishman .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ca n't you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Changing his clothes , he put on his dark-blue flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in Parioli .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They looked at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower Via Veneto , then they went to the Farnese Gardens .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had some amusing scandal about the Farneses in the old days .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then they took a taxi to Trastevere .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` There 's a church you should see '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at Santa Maria he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been there with Alberto .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He let her tell him all about the church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then they had dinner .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When they got home at midnight she was tired out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the Spanish Steps .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She might like to take him to St. Peter 's .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Carla , wake up '' , he said shaking her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's ten o ' clock .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Are n't you going out to mass ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You could take me to St. Peter 's '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Uhhu '' , she muttered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Come on , you 'll be late '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">`` I think I 'll sleep in this morning '' , she said drowsily , and as she snuggled against him , he wondered if she ever went to church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why did he want her to go to church ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he wondered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would be good for her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was too bad he had no feeling himself for church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not his poor mother 's fault .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She would have been better off if she had stuck to her Bible .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As for himself , he just did n't have the temperament for it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then he thought of those Old Testament figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just figures out of a tribal folklore .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Could he honestly believe it would be good for Carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Being a woman though , she would take only what she needed from church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was too bad he was n't a Catholic himself .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Or a Protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists , or a strict orthodox Communist .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What was the matter with him that they all wearied him ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the times , he was sure .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All the ideologies changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was all too wearying .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Look somewhere else .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But where ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just the same , he thought , pondering over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got up and went to church .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Since we 're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I 'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There 's so little to do '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why not '' ?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm not good at that kind of thing '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` This afternoon let 's take an air with them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let 's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were joking .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` If you find it necessary , Sam , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the stair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I am what I am .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I can n't help it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her words remained with him , worrying him for hours .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did n't know how she would behave with other people .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When they walked into the Ferraro apartment , the old lady , bowing and smiling , said softly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Ciao , '' and put out her hand .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Her little brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes gleamed , and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Agnese , smiling too , said , `` ' Ello '' , and then more slowly , `` I am happy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And they sat down and began their little coffee party .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">She would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Watching her , he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Signora Ferraro , bobbing her head encouragingly , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Carla translated .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The old woman had a nephew from North Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment , and who had migrated to Canada to work on the railway .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did many of Sam 's countrymen live in boxcars in the bush ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">she wanted to know .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Regretfully Sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just the same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And Sam thanked her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A very great Pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes sparkling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An intellectual .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But very mystical too .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was said that he had had a vision .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Just as thousands that day in Portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned to Agnese for confirmation .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Agnese had been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity of the unaware .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Holy Father would die soon , she said to Carla , so she could translate for Sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yes , the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No , he was indeed a saint now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nodding approvingly and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered confidentially .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was a certain discontent among the cardinals .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglected them a little .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There would be changes made , and Signor Raymond should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a regime in Rome .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Did Signor Raymond understand ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed he did , Sam said solemnly , trying to get Carla 's eye .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Surely she could see that these women were her Italians , too , he thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in Brooklyn or Malta or Ireland .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Carla ; eyes were on Agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And Carla , watching in wonder , turned to Sam .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` It means so much to her .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It 's like a flame , I guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For a few innings the Anniston team could n't figure him out .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then , in the fifth , Anniston 's kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eddie Lee , Riverside 's redheaded playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Third !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Third base '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eddie shouted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegan 's hands on third base .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You bastard '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the Anniston catcher screamed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The fighters were separated in a few minutes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The game was resumed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil Rossoff , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike Deegan was standing beside it , facing the field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Keep your eyes open , sonny '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike yelled to the catcher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You 're in for trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Anniston catcher did not reply with words .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He simply turned to Mike and smiled .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I 'll get that little bastard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So help me God , I 'll get him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil Rossoff said : `` Why do n't you leave him alone '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Mind your own goddamn business '' , Mike Deegan said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Phil shrugged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He stepped into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Maybe the answer was in his eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder 's head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By the time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The left fielder threw and it was a good one .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Mike had no chance of being tagged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both fell heavily to the ground .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only Mike got to his feet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They poured water over their catcher 's face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did not move .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then the manager called for a doctor .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then , quickly , and a little nervously , the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was followed by four of his men .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It began to look as if something was going to happen .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan 's side .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No one said a word .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His face was flushed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` That was a rotten thing to do '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` For God 's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Stop it , will you ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell your guys not to block the plate '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You did n't have to ram him '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's what you say '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was a cold and calculated look .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He turned and went back across the field to his dugout .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike 's head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He arose slowly and brushed himself off .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He got back into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hit the bum '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">somebody yelled from the Anniston bench .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil 's ear : `` There 's gonna be a fight '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Look at those bastards '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Charlie Haydon , a pitcher , said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` They 're looking for trouble '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mike was slow getting into the box this time .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Listen '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">he shouted to the pitcher .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` One more and I 'm coming out there '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll be waiting '' !</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">the pitcher yelled back .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike 's head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were both walking towards each other , unhurried .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , ballplayers , cops , kids and a dog .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was much shouting and screaming .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After the game , Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` It 's a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy 's own team-mate won n't come out and help him in a fight '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The other players were undressing quietly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eddie Lee had not come in yet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike went over to Phil and stood over him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why the hell did n't you come out when you saw them gang up on me '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I did n't think it was necessary '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Well !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now that 's just fine !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You did n't think it was necessary '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike placed both his hands on his hips .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He pushed his jaw forward .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Listen , wise guy , if you think I 'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you 're crazy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike 's face .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I did n't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Nobody else did , either '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm not trying to say anything '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You 're yellow , Rossoff '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">and Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sat down before Eddie 's desk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You get your unconditional release as of today '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil 's eyes widened just a trifle .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You do n't belong in professional baseball '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil had to clear his throat .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Is this because of what happened out there '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` No '' , Eddie said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But it does confirm what I 've suspected all along '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil stood up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Listen !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is the second time '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm not saying you 're yellow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am saying you 're not a professional ballplayer '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Now listen to me , Phil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I 'm not steering you wrong .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You have n't got the heart for baseball '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Suddenly his voice grew hard .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What the hell do you think baseball is ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">You 're not in the big leagues , but if you can n't give and take down here what the hell do you think it 'll be like up there '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Now do n't tell me what a good ball player you are .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I know you 've got talent .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But what you have n't got is the heart to back up that talent with .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The heart , Phil .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You just have n't got the heart for pro-ball , and that 's it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dazed , Phil said : `` I do n't get it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My batting average & & & '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` What difference does your batting average make ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or your fielding average .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or even the way you run bases .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I tell you when it 's necessary to hurt in order to win - you won n't do it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That 's what I mean by no heart for the game .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Baseball 's no cinch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that 's one less who might take his job away later on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What the hell do you think baseball is ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A sport ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It 's a way of life , goddamit !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And you 've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who want to take your way of life away from you '' !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He 's wrong !</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil thought .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It 's only his opinion .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were other clubs in this league .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He stood up slowly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was a little pale and shaky .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His lips felt glued together .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I think you 're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eddie nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Okay .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You 'll get your pay in the morning '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say :
`` Someday you 'll see I was right '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil shut the door behind him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Outside in the dressing room , Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What happened '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Frankie asked .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil said : `` I got my release '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` You crazy '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil shrugged .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What for '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil sighed .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Frankie shook his head .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't get it '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I do n't know '' , Phil said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were silent for a few moments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil took off one shoe and stared at it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't take it like this '' , Frankie said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The leagues are full of guys like that '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Phil was very quiet .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil did not answer .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Why not try another club '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Phil looked up .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Springfield 's in tomorrow '' , Frankie said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Talk to Whitey Jackson '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He just did n't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Will you do it , Phil '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do what '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Ask Whitey for a job '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Phil nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Sure '' , he said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Springfield come in tomorrow '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Frankie nodded .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll speak to Whitey '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Atta boy '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'll talk to him , all right '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Do n't worry '' , Frankie said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` You 'll get a job there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He needs outfielders bad '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` I 'm not worried about it '' , Phil said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 's the way to talk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What else did Eddie have to say '' ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Nothing '' , Phil said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Up to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he had n't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he had n't found it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was n't his fault that these things were so .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His dogs ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dogs did something to one 's ego .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world 's great guys .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out - and even if they did it would make no difference .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You certainly could n't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Why in the world could n't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Could it be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Or was the answer less metaphysical ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did older people work more slowly ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And then again perhaps the reason why he could n't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he did n't want to do them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no compulsion behind them .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was five minutes after four .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At least he could buy the equipment for his workshop .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thus committed , action might follow .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He went down to Mills and Bradley 's Hardware Store and bought a full set of carpenter 's tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they were .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nails , levels and T squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` There '' , said Mr. Mills .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` That 'll get you started .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Best not to get everything at once .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Add things as you find you need ' em '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He did n't even ask the cost of this collection .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , Jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was glad .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In front of it would be his workbench .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he could n't pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After the pegboard there would be the paneling .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sat down on an old box and focused on the problem .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But then , when you stuck things into the holes , why did n't they come right out again ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It all seemed rather hopeless .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He turned his attention to the workbench .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps that was the first thing to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench - someone who knew what he was about .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After that everything should be simpler .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He went upstairs to phone Crumb .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To his amazement he reached him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He did n't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That was why he had n't been able to finish the porch .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No , he did n't know of any handyman carpenter .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was n't any such thing any more .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Crumb would probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If he was sober , which was doubtful , he 'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into Mr. Crombie 's life since he moved to Highfield , in spite of the fact that he did n't work very fast or very long at a time , and he did n't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they was n't nobody with you .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So Mr. Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. Blatz 's mind from funny things .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">At the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he did n't like to disclose his ignorance .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While Mr. Blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench , Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Blatz agreed that this would be pretty .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` Now '' , he said , `` we got to put in some outlets for them power tools ; then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an ' I guess we 're about through down here '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It all did look very efficient and shipshape .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was no question of that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` By the way '' , said Mr. Blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power tools needs extra voltage .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I guess you know about that .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Before you use ' em the light company 's got to run in a heavy line and you 'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That ai n't too bad ' ceptin ' the light company 's so busy you can n't ever get ' em to do nothin '' ' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead of being depressed by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As usual , Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` I was just sayin ' to him that I 'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Crombie could n't remember his saying any such thing .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">`` Oh , that 's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I have a thousand things for you to do .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Doors that won n't open , and doors that won n't close and shelves and broken '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr. Crombie .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` Those are the things I can do , now that I 'm set up '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">`` I 've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">`` We won n't live long <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enough</MPQAPOL> if I wait for you , <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">besides</MPQAPOL> which you do n't <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">worry</MPQAPOL> - there 'll be <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">plenty</MPQAPOL> more '' .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the discussion was academic .</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">above</MPQAPOL> the kitchen sink .</MPQASENT>
